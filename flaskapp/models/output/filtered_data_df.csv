The world was prepared to face the pandemic since it was anticipated for over one decade. Most countries, including India, had made detailed pandemic preparedness plans well ahead of its actual occurrence. The infection rapidly spread to the whole country within 2-3 months. The national tactics were to slow down its importation through international air travelers and to slow down its spread in cities and major towns. More than 75% of all infected persons were urban dwellers, suggesting that efforts were concentrated in urban communities. In general the illness of pandemic influenza has been similar to endemic/seasonal influenza; however, there is insufficient epidemiological and clinical data on the latter.

METHODS Prospectively collected clinical and radiologic data of consecutive patients with prior endovascular aneurysm repair and evidence of type Ia endoleak were analyzed. All patients were treated between January 2009 and November 2014 by use of parallel grafts, ie, chimney/snorkel or periscope grafts and abdominal endovascular devices. Primary outcome of the study was the technical success. Secondary outcomes were patency of the chimney grafts and shrinkage of aneurysm morphology. RESULTS Technical success was 94.4% (17 of 18). One patient showed evidence of persistent type Ia endoleak after triple chimney graft placement and treated by Onyx embolization (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) successfully. The mean preoperative and postoperative aneurysm diameters were 7.1 ± 1.7 and 7.0 ± 2 cm. Primary patency of the chimney grafts was 96.7% and assisted patency was 100% after successful retrograde recanalization of an acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery from the celiac trunk and the gastroduodenal artery. One patient who had undergone the sandwich technique with transfemoral placement of the flexible Viabahn (W. L.

METHODS The analysis was based on data collected in May 2013 in the ED of Recanto das Emas, Federal District, Brasil, which uses a Manchester Triage System. A total of 100 consecutive patients were included: 70 yellow (70%) and 30 green (30%). Flow patterns, observed waiting time, and inter-arrival times of patients were collected. Process maps, demand, and capacity data were used to build a simulation, which was calibrated against the observed flow times. What-if analysis was conducted to reduce waiting times. RESULTS Green and yellow patient arrival-time patterns were similar, but inter-arrival times were 5 and 38 minutes, respectively. Wait-time was 14 minutes for yellow patients, and 4 hours for green patients. The physician staff comprised four doctors per shift. A simulation predicted that allocating one more doctor per shift would reduce wait-time to 2.5 hours for green patients, with a small impact in yellow patients' wait-time. Maintaining four doctors and allocating one doctor exclusively for green patients would reduce the waiting time to 1.5 hours for green patients and increase it in 15 minutes for yellow patients. The best simulation scenario employed five doctors per shift, with two doctors exclusively for green patients.

These models were developed with the aid of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with shuffling cross-validation technique. A shuffling MARS algorithm is utilized to select the most important variables in QSAR modeling and then these variables were used as inputs of ANFIS to predict SARS inhibitory activities of pyridine N-oxide derivatives. A data set of 119 drug-like compounds was coded with over hundred calculated meaningful molecular descriptors. The best descriptors describing the inhibition mechanism were solvation connectivity index, length to breadth ratio, relative negative charge, harmonic oscillator of aromatic index, average molecular weight and total path count. These parameters are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The statistical parameters of R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.884 and 0.359, respectively. The accuracy and robustness of shuffling MARS–ANFIS model in predicting inhibition behavior of pyridine N-oxide derivatives (pIC50) was illustrated using leave-one-out and leave-multiple-out cross-validation techniques and also by Y-randomization. Comparison of the results of the proposed model with those of GA-PLS-ANFIS shows that the shuffling MARS–ANFIS model is superior and can be considered as a tool for predicting the inhibitory behavior of SARS drug-like molecules.",2009-12-05,"Jalali-Heravi, M.; Asadollahi-Baboli, M.; Mani-Varnosfaderani, A.",Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/de71ae7b74fdc75b489351a1ac5a1b98c76ccfc3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126869.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19665859/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708509004300; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0731708509004300; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2009.07.009,159732.0,en,work inhibitory activity pyridine n-oxide derivative human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars predict term quantitative structure – activity relationship qsar model model develope aid multivariate adaptive regression spline mars adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system anfis combine shuffle cross-validation technique shuffle mars algorithm utilize select important variable qsar model variable use input anfis predict sars inhibitory activity pyridine n-oxide derivative datum set 119 drug-like compound code calculate meaningful molecular descriptor descriptor describe inhibition mechanism solvation connectivity index length breadth ratio relative negative charge harmonic oscillator aromatic index average molecular weight total path count parameter topological electronic geometric constitutional aromaticity descriptor statistical parameter r 2 root mean square error rmse 0.884 0.359 respectively accuracy robustness shuffle mars – anfis model predict inhibition behavior pyridine n-oxide derivative pic50 illustrate use leave-one-out leave-multiple-out cross-validation technique y-randomization comparison result propose model ga-pls-anfis shuffle mars – anfis model superior consider tool predict inhibitory behavior sars drug-like molecule,150

Since 2009, we have used a novel ""side-to-side: staple line-on-staple line"" (STS) technique for intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomoses, designed to create a wide-diameter esophagogastric anastomosis while preserving stomach conduit blood supply. In this study, we describe the technique and review outcomes of our institution's initial 6-year experience. METHODS An institutional database query identified 278 consecutive patients who underwent Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy using an STS esophagogastric anastomotic technique from 2009 through 2015. A retrospective review was conducted to assess outcomes with a focus on anastomotic complications. RESULTS There were a total of 8 (2.9%) anastomotic leaks in patients who underwent STS esophagogastric anastomosis, 3 of which were grade I/II leaks and required no intervention. There was a leak rate of 6.3% (2 of 32) after esophagectomy for benign conditions (both leaks occurring in 8 total patients (25%) who received surgery for end-stage achalasia) compared with a 2.4% leak rate (6 of 246) in whom esophagectomy was performed for malignancy (P = .22). Fourteen patients (5.0%) required a median of 2 dilatations for anastomotic stricture after STS anastomosis. Supplemental jejunostomy feedings were required in only 11.1% of these patients after hospital discharge.

Severity assessment scores partially address the difficulties in identifying high-risk patients. A lack of specific and valid pathophysiologic severity markers affect early and effective sepsis therapy. HMGB-1, sRAGE and RAGE have been involved in sepsis and their potential as severity markers has been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate HMGB-1, RAGE and sRAGE levels in patients with CAP-associated sepsis and determine their possible association with clinical outcome. METHOD: We evaluated 33 patients with CAP-associated sepsis admitted to the emergency room and followed in the medical wards. Severity assessment scores (CURB-65, PSI, APACHE II, SOFA) and serologic markers (HMGB-1, RAGE, sRAGE) were evaluated on admission. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of CAP-associated sepsis were enrolled in the study within 24 hours after admission. Fourteen (46.6%) had pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus, 2 (6.6%) had seasonal influenza A and 14 other diagnoses. Of the patients in the study group, 16 (53.3%) had a fatal outcome. ARDS was observed in 17 (56.6%) and a total of 22 patients had severe sepsis on admission (73%). The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and non-surviving groups (P = .003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P = .005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher in non-surviving (P = .058) and ARDS patients (P = .058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P = .013) and sRAGE (P = .05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome.

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate.

BACKGROUND Women are at increased risk of bleeding and vascular complications after PCI. The role of radial access in women is unclear. METHODS Women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI were randomized to radial or femoral arterial access. Data from the CathPCI Registry and trial-specific data were merged into a final study database. The primary efficacy endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding or vascular complications requiring intervention. The primary feasibility endpoint was access site crossover. The primary analysis cohort was the subgroup undergoing PCI; sensitivity analyses were conducted in the total randomized population. RESULTS The trial was stopped early for a lower than expected event rate. A total of 1,787 women (691 undergoing PCI) were randomized at 60 sites. There was no significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between radial or femoral access among women undergoing PCI (radial 1.2% vs. 2.9% femoral, odds ratio [OR]: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12 to 1.27); among women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI, radial access significantly reduced bleeding and vascular complications (0.6% vs. 1.7%; OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90). Access site crossover was significantly higher among women assigned to radial access (PCI cohort: 6.1% vs. 1.7%; OR: 3.65; 95% CI: 1.45 to 9.17); total randomized cohort: (6.7% vs. 1.9%; OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 2.14 to 6.40). More women preferred radial access. CONCLUSIONS In this pragmatic trial, which was terminated early, the radial approach did not significantly reduce bleeding or vascular complications in women undergoing PCI. Access site crossover occurred more often in women assigned to radial access.

Intense immediate postoperative pain after many spinal procedures makes its control of utmost importance. Preemptive injection of local anesthetics can significantly reduce postoperative pain during rest and movement; however, the analgesic effect is only maintained for a relatively short period of time. Whether betamethasone combined with local anesthetic for laminoplasty or laminectomy has better short-term and long-term effects than the local anesthetic alone has not been reported yet. METHODS The PRE-EASE trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, single-center clinical study including 116 participants scheduled for elective laminoplasty or laminectomy, with a 6 months' follow-up process. Preemptive local infiltration with betamethasone and ropivacaine (treatment group) or ropivacaine alone (control group) throughout the entire thickness of the planned incision site will be performed by the surgeon prior to making the incision. The primary outcome will be the cumulative butorphanol consumption within the first 48-h postoperative period. DISCUSSION This study will add significant new knowledge to the effect and feasibility of preemptive local infiltration of betamethasone for postoperative pain management in laminoplasty and laminectomy.

The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2 years, hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. RESULTS: A total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases. In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses. Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains. CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide. Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.

The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed hypoxic COVID–19 patients who were consecutively admitted between March 13, 2020 and April 19, 2020. Patients with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab if no contraindication was present. Systemic steroid, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for majority of the patients. FINDINGS: Of the 51 patients included for analysis, 28 (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs. 22%) at baseline and during entire hospitalization (75% vs. 48%). The median time to clinical improvement in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts was 8 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 6·25 – 9·75 days) vs. 13 days (IQR: 9·75 – 15·25 days) among patients who required mechanical ventilation at any time (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·57 – 5·84) and 6·5 days vs. 7 days among all patients (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·14, 95% CI: 0·55 – 2·38), respectively. The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation were 2 days (IQR: 1·75 – 4·25 days) vs. 5 days (IQR: 4 – 8 days), p = 0.039, and 7 days (IQR: 4 – 14 days) vs. 10 days (IQR: 5 – 15 days) in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts, p = 0.11, respectively. Similar rates of hospital–acquired infections occurred in both cohorts (18% in tocilizumab and 22% in no tocilizumab cohort). INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor support. Although not statistically significant, tocilizumab also resulted in shorter median time to clinical improvement and shorter duration of invasive ventilation. These findings require validation from ongoing clinical trials of Tocilizumab in COVID–19 patients.",2020-06-20,"Kewan, Tariq; Covut, Fahrettin; Al–Jaghbeer, Mohammed J.; Rose, Lori; Gopalakrishna, K.V.; Akbik, Bassel",EClinicalMedicine,,#610020,,document_parses/pdf_json/e1e63a4d4a200579e6279066dc5cd9cc6a8600d0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7305505.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537020301620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020301620; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100418,219895890.0,en,background tocilizumab approve chimeric antigen receptor t – cell therapy induce cytokine release syndrome provide clinical benefit select covid–19 patient methods retrospective cohort study analyze hypoxic covid–19 patient consecutively admit march 13 2020 april 19 2020 patients lung infiltrate elevate inflammatory marker receive single dose tocilizumab contraindication present systemic steroid hydroxychloroquine azithromycin concomitantly use majority patient findings 51 patient include analysis 28 55 receive tocilizumab 23 45 receive tocilizumab tocilizumab cohort require invasive ventilation 68 vs. 22 baseline entire hospitalization 75 vs. 48 median time clinical improvement tocilizumab vs. tocilizumab cohort 8 day interquartile range iqr 6·25 – 9·75 day vs. 13 day iqr 9·75 – 15·25 day patient require mechanical ventilation time hazard ratio clinical improvement 1·83 95 confidence interval ci 0·57 – 5·84 6·5 day vs. 7 day patient hazard ratio clinical improvement 1·14 95 ci 0·55 – 2·38 respectively median duration vasopressor support invasive mechanical ventilation 2 day iqr 1·75 – 4·25 day vs. 5 day iqr 4 – 8 day p 0.039 7 day iqr 4 – 14 day vs. 10 day iqr 5 – 15 day tocilizumab vs. tocilizumab cohort p 0.11 respectively similar rate hospital – acquire infection occur cohort 18 tocilizumab 22 tocilizumab cohort interpretation patient severe covid-19 tocilizumab associate significantly short duration vasopressor support statistically significant tocilizumab result short median time clinical improvement short duration invasive ventilation finding require validation ongoing clinical trial tocilizumab covid–19 patient,234

Discontinuation of radiation treatments is not desirable and potentially life-threatening. On the other hand, accesses to hospital expose cancer patients to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. We report our extended protocol, draft to manage clinical activities in our radiotherapy department, by minimizing contagion risks. METHODS: We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission. A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms. New treatments were stratified according to priority codes. A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff. Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers. The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation.

These hypotheses can then motivate further research that empirically tests them. The three PHEICs suggest that deferred global mobilization is a greater source of delay than is poor surveillance capacity. These case study outbreaks support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for novel diseases when outbreaks do not coincide with holidays and when US citizens are infected.

In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagy-inducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide- and pimozide-treated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy.

On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged ≥ 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18–30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower.

However, blind advancement may result in misplacement of left-sided DLTs into the right bronchus. Therefore, incidence, risk factors, and blind repositioning techniques for right bronchial misplacement of left-sided DLTs were investigated. METHODS This was an observational cohort study performed on the data depository consecutively collected from patients who underwent intubation of left-sided DLTs for 2 years. Patients' clinical and anatomical characteristics were analyzed to investigate risk factors for DLT misplacements with logistic regression analysis. Moreover, when DLTs were misplaced into the right bronchus, the bronchial tube was withdrawn into the trachea and blindly readvanced without rotation, or with 90° or 180° counterclockwise rotation while the patient's head was turned right. RESULTS DLTs were inadvertently advanced into the right bronchus in 48 of 1135 (4.2 %) patients. DLT misplacements occurred more frequently in females, in patients of short stature or with narrow trachea and bronchi, and when small-sized DLTs were used. All of these factors were significantly inter-correlated each other (P < 0.001). In 40 of the 48 (83.3 %) patients, blind repositioning was successful. CONCLUSIONS Smaller left-sided DLTs were more frequently misplaced into the right mainstem bronchus than larger DLTs. Moreover, we were usually able to reposition the misplaced DLTs into the left bronchus by using the blind techniques.

The outbreak has caused alarm among social and news media as to the virulence and transmission potential of the Aedes mosquito-borne virus. This debate is heightened by the proximity, both in time and distance, to the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro this August, provoking fears for the safety of athletes and spectators alike. The threat, real or perceived, is exacerbated by the movement between nations in the same or separate continents of persons who act unwittingly as asymptomatic carriers. Pregnant females are considered at greatest risk because microcephaly in newborn infants is linked to, if not yet proven as caused by, Zika infection. In February this year, the World Health Organization declared that further to the then unconfirmed association between the virus and the clinical manifestations of microcephaly and also Guillain-Barré syndrome, the Zika epidemic was a “public health emergency of international concern”. No anti-Zika therapy, vaccine or drug, is currently available and while the production of the former has now been prioritized by multiple funding agencies, the history of infectious disease vaccine development indicates that this may take several years to reach the market place. The fact that Zika is a close relative of yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, for both of which there are already effective vaccines, provides a rational basis for the fast-tracked laboratory-based preparation of a candidate vaccine. However, undertaking clinical trials on pregnant females provides ethical and practical hurdles to overcome before licensure is granted for public administration.

A direct aspiration first-pass (ADAPT) technique for stroke thrombectomy was recently shown to be an effective and rapid way to achieve revascularization. The technique focuses on engaging and removing a clot without the use of a separator or retriever by relying on the force and aspiration generated by the catheter. We sought to compare the physical and fluid dynamic properties (force and aspiration) of commercially available catheters to determine the most effective catheter for the ADAPT technique. METHODS Benchtop models were employed to compare aspiration for each catheter by submersing the catheter into a graduated cylinder and aspirating water. The volume of fluid aspirated and flow rates were calculated. Force of aspiration at the tip of each catheter was measured using a vacuum pressure gauge while the catheter was attached to a standard aspiration pump. Force was then calculated. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE catheter had the greatest aspiration rate of all the catheters at 245 mL/min. The Penumbra 5 MAX catheter aspirated 212 mL/min, followed by the Navien 058 and DAC 057 with 198 mL/min and 197 mL/min, respectively. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE generated the greatest tip force (18.25 g) and the 5MAX had the least amount of force (14.77 g).

This report presents a genomic and bioinformatics analysis of the prototype 35,990-nucleotide genome (GenBank accession no. AY594253). Intriguingly, the genome analysis suggests a closer phylogenetic relationship with the chimpanzee adenoviruses (simian adenoviruses) rather than with other human adenoviruses, suggesting a recent origin of HAdV-4, and therefore species E, through a zoonotic event from chimpanzees to humans. Bioinformatics analysis also suggests a pre-zoonotic recombination event, as well, between species B-like and species C-like simian adenoviruses. These observations may have implications for the current interest in using chimpanzee adenoviruses in the development of vectors for human gene therapy and for DNA-based vaccines. Also, the reemergence, surveillance, and treatment of HAdV-4 as an ARD pathogen is an opportunity to demonstrate the use of genome determination as a tool for viral infectious disease characterization and epidemic outbreak surveillance: for example, rapid and accurate low-pass sequencing and analysis of the genome.

Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box–Behnken design was applied to determine optimal conditions. The following optimized UMAE processing parameters were obtained: sonication time (96.13 s), microwave power (305.28 W), and solid/solvent ratio (1:37). Based on a total phenolic compound extraction yield of 9.21 mg gallic acid (GA) equ/g dry weight (DW), a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.52 μg GA equ, and an antioxidant capacity detected by 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay of 8.79 mg trolox equ/g DW. The optimized UMAE extract was superior to those obtained using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) or conventional solvent extraction (CSE) methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the three extraction methods affected the sample tissue microstructure. Among them, UMAE caused the most marked structural disruption. UPLC-PDA-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 67 phenolic compounds in the optimized UMAE extract of the Foshou fruit extract. This study indicated that the integrated UMAE technique is a suitable and safe technique to enhance the qualitative and quantitative extraction of phenolic compounds from Foshou fruit. These phenolic compounds can be used as a functional food ingredient in industrial production. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]",2019-03-08,"Mahdi, Amer Ali; Rashed, Marwan M.

Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear—extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade.

However, the lack of clinical and epidemiological data hampers the interpretation of these diagnostic findings. From October 2009 to January 2011, we conducted a prospective study in hospitalized children from whom samples were taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological data from 644 patients with 904 disease episodes were collected. When HRV tested positive, strains were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome. HRV was the single respiratory virus detected in 254 disease episodes (28%). Overall, 99 different serotypes were detected (47% HRV-A, 12% HRV-B, 39% HRV-C). Patients with HRV had more underlying pulmonary illness compared with patients with no virus (p 0.01), or patients with another respiratory virus besides HRV (p 0.007). Furthermore, cough, shortness of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with HRV infection. Particularly, patients with HRV-B required extra oxygen. No respiratory symptom, except for oxygen need, was predictive of the presence of HRV. In 22% of HRV-positive disease episodes, HRV infection was hospital acquired.

We use 4-taxon simulations to study the effects of ambiguous data (i.e., missing characters or gaps) in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. By introducing ambiguous data in a way that removes confounding factors, we provide the first clear understanding of 1 mechanism by which ambiguous data can mislead phylogenetic analyses. We find that in both ML and Bayesian frameworks, among-site rate variation can interact with ambiguous data to produce misleading estimates of topology and branch lengths. Furthermore, within a Bayesian framework, priors on branch lengths and rate heterogeneity parameters can exacerbate the effects of ambiguous data, resulting in strongly misleading bipartition posterior probabilities. The magnitude and direction of the ambiguous data bias are a function of the number and taxonomic distribution of ambiguous characters, the strength of topological support, and whether or not the model is correctly specified.

Prior work has suggested that collateral thermal damage resulting from electrocautery use during skin flap development is a potential source of this complication. This report describes the case of a smoker with recurrent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who experienced significant unilateral skin necrosis following bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy while participating in a clinical trial examining mastectomy outcomes with two different surgical devices. This unexpected complication has implications for the choice of dissection devices in procedures requiring skin flap preservation. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who was a smoker with recurrent DCIS of her right breast. As part of the clinical trial, each breast was randomized to either the standard of care treatment group (a scalpel and a traditional electrosurgical device) or treatment with a novel, low thermal injury dissection device, allowing for a direct, internally controlled comparison of surgical outcomes. Post-operative follow-up at six days was unremarkable for both operative sites. At 16 days post-surgery, the patient presented with a significant wound necrosis in the mastectomy site randomized to the control study group. Following debridement and closure, this site progressively healed over 10 weeks. The contralateral mastectomy, randomized to the alternative device, healed normally. CONCLUSION We hypothesize that thermal damage to the subcutaneous microvasculature during flap dissection may have contributed to this complication and that the use of a low thermal injury dissection device may be advantageous in select patients undergoing skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomy.",2011,"Fine, Richard E; Vose, Joshua G",Journal of medical case reports,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-5-212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21619665/,16546921.0,en,introduction skin- nipple-sparing mastectomy technique offer distinct cosmetic reconstructive advantage traditional method partial skin flap nipple necrosis remain significant source post-operative morbidity prior work suggest collateral thermal damage result electrocautery use skin flap development potential source complication report describe case smoker recurrent ductal carcinoma situ dcis experience significant unilateral skin necrosis follow bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy participate clinical trial examine mastectomy outcome different surgical device unexpected complication implication choice dissection device procedure require skin flap preservation case presentation patient 61-year-old caucasian woman smoker recurrent dcis right breast clinical trial breast randomize standard care treatment group scalpel traditional electrosurgical device treatment novel low thermal injury dissection device allow direct internally control comparison surgical outcome post-operative follow-up day unremarkable operative site 16 day post-surgery patient present significant wind necrosis mastectomy site randomize control study group following debridement closure site progressively heal 10 week contralateral mastectomy randomize alternative device heal normally conclusion hypothesize thermal damage subcutaneous microvasculature flap dissection contribute complication use low thermal injury dissection device advantageous select patient undergo skin- nipple-sparing mastectomy,170

They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat–animal and bat–human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.",2019-02-20,"Wong, Antonio C.

We have developed kinase translocation reporters (KTRs), which enable multiplexed measurements of the dynamics of kinase activity at a single-cell level. These KTRs are composed of an engineered construct in which a kinase substrate is fused to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bNLS) and nuclear export signal (NES), as well as to a fluorescent protein for microscopy-based detection of its localization. The negative charge introduced by phosphorylation of the substrate is used to directly modulate nuclear import and export, thereby regulating the reporter's distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The relative cytoplasmic versus nuclear fluorescence of the KTR construct (the C/N ratio) is used as a proxy for the kinase activity in living, single cells. Multiple KTRs can be studied in the same cell by fusing them to different fluorescent proteins. Here, we present a protocol to execute and analyze live-cell microscopy experiments using KTRs. We describe strategies for development of new KTRs and procedures for lentiviral expression of KTRs in a cell line of choice. Cells are then plated in a 96-well plate, from which multichannel fluorescent images are acquired with automated time-lapse microscopy.

METHODS Our clinical database was reviewed to identify operative cases of craniopharyngiomas between July 1998 and January 2011. Only patients who had retrochiasmatic extension and underwent an eyebrow approach were included in this analysis. Endoscopy was used to aid surgical resection at the discretion of the surgeon. Six patients were identified (three from a retrospective review and three during the course of prospective follow-up evaluation). RESULTS The group included three men and three women (mean age: 41.2 years; range: 28-57 years). All patients had visual and hormonal deficits at presentation. Complete resection was achieved in four patients. Endoscopic assistance was used in three patients. Opening of the frontal sinus occurred in two cases during surgery; an additional surgical procedure was required for repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak in one of these cases.

People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. RESULTS: The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019.

In addition to an antitumor effect, IFNs show antiangiogenic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IFN-α and IFN-β on human micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells in vitro [human micro vascular lung endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) and human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC)]. By immunohistochemical staining and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, we studied expression of type I IFN receptors. We evaluated the effects of IFN-α and IFN-β on the proliferation (DNA content), apoptosis (DNA fragmentation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and cell cycle distribution (flow-cytometric analysis) of endothelial cells. HUVEC and HMVEC-L cells show comparable expression level of the distinct IFN receptor subtypes. Proliferation of HMVEC-L and HUVEC was inhibited by IFN-β (the half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 60 and 90 IU/mL, respectively), but not by IFN-α at a dose up to 1,000 IU/mL. An interesting and unexpected observation was an inhibition of apoptosis by IFN-β. After 72 h of treatment with IFN-β. Cell cycle inhibition occurs in late S-phase in both cell lines.

However, these measures may interfere in the normal medical service. We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China. METHODS: Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. RESULTS: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926–67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April.

OBJECTIVE To examine the nationwide burden of neurological conditions requiring emergency neurosurgery. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2002-2011) was queried to identify adult patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of a neurosurgical condition who were admitted urgently/emergently or through a trauma center and underwent surgical intervention within 2 days of admission. Diagnostic groups were ranked based on their inpatient complication and mortality burden, and their contribution to total complications, deaths, hospital charges, and length of stay (LOS) was assessed. All analyses were weighted to produce national estimates. RESULTS After application of discharge weights, 810 404 patients who underwent emergency neurosurgery were identified. The average complication rate for the entire sample was 8.8%, the mortality rate was 11.2%, average charges were $106 802, and average LOS was 9.0 days. The top 4 diagnostic groups ranked by complication/mortality burden accounted for 76% of all complications, 96% of all deaths, 81% of all charges, and 82% of all days in the hospital for the entire study sample. This was equal to 62 648 complications, 86 683 deaths, $69 billion in charges, and 5962 932 days.

Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and UF. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and plasma samples from children with UF and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in NP and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus MLB-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive PCR assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average NP and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with UF. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever.

Methods: We reviewed and compiled the responses to our questions on Twitter regarding the management and safety of deferred treatment in the setting of COVID‐19 related constraints on non‐urgent care. We chronicled the guidance published on this subject by various health authorities and professional organizations. Further, we analyzed peerreviewed literature on the safety of deferred treatment (surgery or systemic therapy) to make made evidence‐based recommendations. Results: Due to the rapidly changing information about epidemiology and infectious characteristics of COVID‐19, the health authorities and professional societies guidance required frequent revisions which by design take days or weeks to produce. Several active discussions on Twitter provided real‐time updates on the changing landscape of the restrictions being placed on non‐urgent care. For separate discussion threads on prostate cancer and bladder cancer, dozens of specialists with expertise in treating urologic cancers could be engaged in providing their expert opinions as well as share evidence to support their recommendations. Our analysis of published studies addressing the safety and extent to which delayed cancer care does not compromise oncological outcome revealed that most prostate cancer care and certain aspects of the bladder and kidney cancer care can be safely deferred for 2‐6 months. Urothelial bladder cancer and advanced kidney cancer require a higher priority for timely surgical care. We did not find evidence to support the idea of using nonsurgical therapies, such as hormone therapy for prostate cancer or chemotherapy for bladder cancer for safer deferment of previously planned surgery. We noted that the comments and recommendations made by the participants in the Twitter discussions were generally consistent with our evidence‐based recommendations for safely postponing cancer care for certain types of urologic cancers. Conclusion: The use of social media platforms, such as Twitter, where the comments and recommendations are subject to review and critique by other specialists is not only feasible but quite useful in addressing the situations requiring urgent resolution, often supported by published evidence. In circumstances such as natural disasters, this may be a preferable approach than the traditional expert panels due to its ability to harness the collective intellect to available experts to provide responses and solutions in real‐time.

At present, there is significant data available about molecular mechanisms that regulate autophagy. Nevertheless, autophagy pathway itself and its importance in different cellular aspects are still not completely clear. In this article, we are focused in four main aspects: (a) Induction of Autophagy: Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism induced by nutrient starvation or lack of growth factors. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy is a cell response to stress which starts as a consequence of organelle damage, such as oxidative species and other stress conditions. (b) Initiation of Autophagy; The two major actors in this signaling process are mTOR and AMPK. These multitasking protein complexes are capable to summarize the whole environmental, nutritional, and energetic status of the cell and promote the autophagy induction by means of the ULK1-Complex, that is the first member in the autophagy initiation. (c) ULK1-Complex: This is a highly regulated complex responsible for the initiation of autophagosome formation. We review the post-transductional modifications of this complex, considering the targets of ULK1. (d)The mechanisms involved in autophagosome formation. In this section we discuss the main events that lead to the initial structures in autophagy. The BECN1-Complex with PI3K activity and the proper recognition of PI3P are one of these. Also, the transmembrane proteins, such as VMP1 and ATG9, are critically involved. The membrane origin and the cellular localization of autophagosome biogenesis will be also considered.

87136,8sivzh1m,,Medline,Chemokine regulation of inflammation during acute viral infection.,,,14612671,unk,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Chemokines are important inflammatory mediators, and regulate disease due to viral infection. This article will discuss scientific papers published primarily since June 2002 that have introduced new concepts in how chemokines regulate the inflammatory response to specific viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Acute respiratory viruses commonly induce inflammatory chemokines such as CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) and CCL5 (RANTES), which can amplify inflammatory responses leading to immunopathology. Where single agent therapy fails, combination antiviral and anti-CCL3 treatment is synergistic and able to prevent mortality in mice infected with the highly lethal pneumonia virus of mice. Human herpesvirus-6 also induces production of CCL3 and CCL5, which are able to block HIV-1 replication in coinfected human lymphoid tissue. On this basis, Margolis has proposed a new and general approach to the treatment and prevention of infection by viral pathogens. SUMMARY Inflammatory chemokines play both beneficial and harmful roles in infectious diseases caused by viruses. Blocking them or using them as immunomodulators, depending on the virus, may be rational approaches to treatment or prevention of disease. With regard to blockade, combination antiviral/antichemokine therapy is a new strategy worth considering as a general therapeutic approach to viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). With regard to immunomodulation, use of weak or attenuated viruses to skew the local cytokine network to a configuration able to inhibit a pathogen is a new and interesting concept, but is fraught with important safety issues.

Food consumption is one factor that can significantly alter the bioavailability of some drugs. This manuscript describes a research approach to determine what recommendations to give patients regarding taking oral ziprasidone in relation to food consumption. Four pharmacokinetic studies, the first three in volunteers and the fourth in patients at steady-state on the maximum recommended daily dose of ziprasidone, investigated the relationship between food intake and ziprasidone absorption. These studies illustrate how sequential studies are used in drug development to investigate increasingly precise questions using data from one study to refine the question being addressed by the next. In the first study, the absorption of ziprasidone was shown to double when taken following a high-calorie, high-fat meal versus the fasting state. The second study showed that the difference in absorption between the fasting and fed states increased with dose. The third study suggested that calorie rather than fat content was the critical variable. This finding was confirmed in the fourth study over a wider variety of meals and under clinically relevant dosing conditions. That study also found reduced pharmacokinetic variability (i.e., more consistent absorption) when ziprasidone was administered with 500-1000 kcal meals without regard to fat content rather than under fasting or low-calorie meal conditions. These results have several clinically important implications. First, the effect of taking ziprasidone in a fasting state cannot be overcome simply by increasing the dose. Second, significant swings in ziprasidone concentration and hence efficacy and tolerability may occur on a day-to-day basis if diet is not controlled. Third, patients should be advised to take ziprasidone with a meal containing at least 500 calories (without regard to fat content) to ensure adequate ziprasidone bioavailability and thus achieve optimal efficacy. These four studies illustrate the sequential and incremental nature of drug development research and what is meant by the concept of bioequivalence.",2010,"Lincoln, Jana; Stewart, Mark E; Preskorn, Sheldon H",Journal of psychiatric practice,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.pra.0000369971.64908.dc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20511734/,3436431.0,en,determining drug dose regimen produce consistent bioavailability patient effect goal drug development process food consumption factor significantly alter bioavailability drug manuscript describe research approach determine recommendation patient regard oral ziprasidone relation food consumption pharmacokinetic study ﻿1 volunteer 4 patient steady-state maximum recommend daily dose ziprasidone investigate relationship food intake ziprasidone absorption study illustrate sequential study use drug development investigate increasingly precise question use datum study refine question address ﻿1 study absorption ziprasidone double follow high-calorie high-fat meal versus fast state 2 study difference absorption fast feed state increase dose 3 study suggest calorie fat content critical variable find confirm 4 study wide variety meal clinically relevant dose condition study find reduce pharmacokinetic variability i.e. consistent absorption ziprasidone administer 500 1000 kcal meal regard fat content fast low-calorie meal condition result clinically important implication effect ziprasidone fast state overcome simply increase dose second significant swing ziprasidone concentration efficacy tolerability occur day-to-day basis diet control patient advise ziprasidone meal contain little 500 calory regard fat content ensure adequate ziprasidone bioavailability achieve optimal efficacy study illustrate sequential incremental nature drug development research mean concept bioequivalence,182

They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",2016-12-31,"Barr, J.

The start codon of the BM2 ORF overlaps the stop codon of the M1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG and ∼10% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon reinitiate translation at the overlapping AUG. BM2 synthesis requires the presence of, and translation through, 45 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG, known as the ‘termination upstream ribosome binding site’ (TURBS). This region may tether ribosomal 40S subunits to the mRNA following termination and a short region of the TURBS, motif 1, with complementarity to helix 26 of 18S rRNA has been implicated in this process. Here, we provide further evidence for a direct interaction between mRNA and rRNA using antisense oligonucleotide targeting and functional analysis in yeast cells. The TURBS also binds initiation factor eIF3 and we show here that this protein stimulates reinitiation from both wild-type and defective TURBS when added exogenously, perhaps by stabilising ribosome-mRNA interactions. Further, we show that the position of the TURBS with respect to the UAA UG overlap is crucial, and that termination too far downstream of the 18S complementary sequence inhibits the process, probably due to reduced 40S tethering. However, in reporter mRNAs where the restart codon alone is moved downstream, termination-reinitiation is inhibited but not abolished, thus the site of reinitiation is somewhat flexible. Reinitiation on distant AUGs is not inhibited in eIF4G-depleted RRL, suggesting that the tethered 40S subunit can move some distance without a requirement for linear scanning.",2011-02-08,"Powell, Michael L.; Leigh, Kendra E.; Pöyry, Tuija A.

Antiviral drugs exhibit limited efficacy unless administered early and may induce viral resistance. Thus, targeting the host response directly has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy with the added potential benefit of not eliciting viral resistance. Severe influenza virus infections are complicated by respiratory failure due to the development of lung microvascular leak and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that enhancing lung endothelial barrier integrity could improve the outcome. Here we demonstrate that the Tie2-agonist tetrameric peptide Vasculotide improves survival in murine models of severe influenza, even if administered as late as 72 hours after infection; the benefit was observed using three strains of the virus and two strains of mice. The effect required Tie2, was independent of viral replication and did not impair lung neutrophil recruitment. Administration of the drug decreased lung edema, arterial hypoxemia and lung endothelial apoptosis; importantly, Vasculotide is inexpensive to produce, is chemically stable and is unrelated to any Tie2 ligands.

A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is utilizing social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence.

During the last 50 years, extensive data have been gathered enabling a study of time trends in the prevalence of common diseases in this age group. OBJECTIVES To examine the current prevalence of common diseases, compare the results with those of previous cohorts, and assess the influence of the massive immigration during the 1990s. METHODS The health examination at the recruitment centers includes a medical history, complete physical examination, and review of medical documentation provided by the family physician. If needed, additional tests and referral to specialists are ordered. The prevalence of selected diseases and severity was drawn from the computerized database of the classification board. Two cohorts, 1992-94 and 2003-04, were examined and compared with three previous cohort studies in 1957-61, 1977-78 and 1982-84. Data were stratified according to origin and country of birth. RESULTS The prevalence of asthma increased dramatically during the years from 10.2 per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 111.6 per 1000 examinees in 2003-04. The prevalence of tuberculosis declined and then increased from 0.6 per 1000 adolescents in 1982-84 to 2.4 per 1000 adolescents in 2003-04. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus increased from 0.2 cases per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 0.8 cases in 1977-78 and 1982-84 and 0.9 cases per 1000 examinees in 2003-04. The prevalence of severe heart defects and severe epilepsy declined in the last 20 years (1.4 and 1.7 cases per 1000 examinees in the 1982-84 cohort to 0.4 and 0.3 cases per 1000 examinees in the 2003-4 cohort respectively).

We aimed to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number for Jodhpur, India and to use it for prediction of epidemic size for next one month. Methods: Contact tracing of SARSCoV2 infected individuals was done to obtain the serial intervals. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived and epidemic projection was done using R software v4.0.0. Results: From among 79 infector infectee pairs, the estimated median and 95 percentile values of serial interval were 5.98 days (95% CI 5.39 to 6.65) and 13.17 days (95% CI 11.27 to 15.57), respectively. The overall R0 value in the first 30 days of outbreak was 1.64 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.25) which subsequently decreased to 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.09). The instantaneous R0 value over 14 days window ranged from a peak of 3.71 (95% CI 1.85 -2.08) to 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96) as on 24 June 2020. The projected COVID-19 case-load over next one month was 1881 individuals. Reduction of R0 from 1.17 to 1.085 could result in 23% reduction in projected epidemic size over the next one month. Conclusion: Aggressive testing, contact-tracing and isolation of infected individuals in Jodhpur district resulted in reduction of R0. Further strengthening of control measures could lead to substantial reduction of COVID19 epidemic size.

We evaluated whether patients in a LTLFW had significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared to those in nonconstant-temperature NICU (room temperature). The association of temperature with the prevalence of ABP and A. baumannii isolates (ABI) found in NICU patients was specifically investigated. In vitro microbiological experiments were conducted to measure the proliferation, antibiotic sensitivity, and genomic profiles of A. baumannii (AB) that grew in variable temperatures. MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW had significantly improved outcomes than those in the room temperature NICU. In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria. Consistent with these clinical observations, AB growing at 20°C and 25°C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance compared to those growing at 35°C. The expression of genes related to AB survival ability, drug resistance, and virulence also differed between AB growing at 20°C and those at 35°C. LTLFW is effective in promoting the recovery of MDR-ABP patients because low temperatures reduced the density and virulence of AB and enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics, likely at the genetic level.

No significant difference in the pore dimension was found in different treatment groups (p>0.05). Increases in pore depth corresponded with increases in the laser energy. Laser ablation was found to affect the mechanical properties of the hoof membrane. In in vitro permeation studies, laser ablation resulted in a significant increase in the drug cumulative delivery, flux, and permeability coefficient as compared to the untreated group (n=3, p<0.05).

On March the 11th the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with over 118,000 cases in more than 110 countries around the world. In response to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, clinical trial research assessing the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are emerging at an unprecedented rate. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION After a priori protocol registration with PROSPERO (181483), a systematic research of the published literature was conducted on 24 April 2020 using Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), and WHO databases. Moreover, to explore the more recent literature we also searched the preprint server medRxiv. Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database for identifying relevant ongoing clinical trials. Thereafter we selected the articles according to the PRISMA guidelines. Animal or in-vitro experimental studies were excluded. Moreover editorials, commentaries, abstracts, reviews, book chapters, and articles not in English were not included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 pre-print articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials. Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19. The first group included phase I/II trials with different types of molecules (DNA or mRNA vaccine, bacterial plasmid or viral vectors), the latter were phase III/IV trials designed on the basis of a heterologous lymphocyte activation by the BCG vaccine. CONCLUSIONS This new disease is pushing the scientific community to develop swiftly a safe and effective vaccine. Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans.

We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on detailed information of 10 940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province. METHODS: In this modelling study, we first estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from 10 January to 5 April 2020 with a newly proposed model, based on the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by 23 January 2020 retrieved from official websites of provincial and municipal health commissions. Since some confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust for these missing values. We then calculate the reporting rate in Wuhan from 20 January to 5 April 2020. Finally, we estimate the date when the first infected case occurred in Wuhan. RESULTS: We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by 10 January 2020, as 3229 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3139–3321) and 51 273 (95% CI: 49 844–52 734) by 5 April 2020. The reporting rate has grown rapidly from 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5–1.6%) on 20 January 2020, to 39.1% (95% CI: 38.0–40.2%) on 11 February 2020, and increased to 71.4% (95% CI: 69.4–73.4%) on 13 February 2020, and reaches 97.6% (95% CI: 94.8–100.3%) on 5 April 2020. The date of first infection is estimated as 30 November 2019. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, the testing capacity of Wuhan was insufficient. Clinical diagnosis could be a good complement to the method of confirmation at that time.

METHODS An IRB approved, single institution retrospective review of patient outcomes after hiatal hernia repair with magnetic sphincter augmentation was performed. Data were obtained from the electronic health record and stored in a REDCap database. Using statistical software, the patient data were analyzed and stratified to assess the specific variables of the perioperative and postoperative course focusing on the high risk of hiatal hernia recurrence group (HRHR) and low risk hiatal hernia of recurrence group (LRHR). The HRHR group received a gastropexy and were defined using the following variables: comorbid state increasing abdominal pressure, gastric herniation > 30%, maximum transverse crural diameter > 4 cm, age 70 years or older, previous hiatal or abdominal wall hernia repair, BMI > 34, heavy weight bearing job/hobby, and/or emergent repair. RESULTS Hiatal hernia repair with magnetic sphincter augmentation was performed on 137 patients. The HRHR group (N = 86) and the LRHR group (N = 51) were compared and there was a difference observed with acute hernia recurrence, dysphagia (p value = 0.008), and number of post-op EGDs (p value = 0.005) in favor of the HRHR group. Other postoperative variables observed (i.e., length of stay and PPI use) showed no significant difference between the two groups.

Neurological complications are typically represented by acute ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions, which induce higher morbidity and mortality. The primary goal of this study was to assess the prognostic value of cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (StcO2) on mortality in neonates and young infants treated with ECMO. A secondary objective was to evaluate the association between StcO2 and the occurrence of cerebral lesions. STUDY DESIGN This was a prospective study in infants < 3 months of age admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and requiring ECMO support. MEASUREMENTS The assessment of cerebral perfusion was made by continuous StcO2 monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors placed on the two temporo-parietal regions. Neurological lesions were identified by MRI or transfontanellar echography. RESULTS Thirty-four infants <3 months of age were included in the study over a period of 18 months. The ECMO duration was 10±7 days. The survival rate was 50% (17/34 patients), and the proportion of brain injuries was 20% (7/34 patients). The mean StcO2 during ECMO in the non-survivors was reduced in both hemispheres (p = 0.0008 right, p = 0.03 left) compared to the survivors.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. SAMPLE POPULATION Sixteen first-year veterinary students. METHODS Veterinary students were taught 3 knots: surgeon's, Miller's, and strangle. After having demonstrated competence, students tied each knot twice in a vascular ligation model at physiologic pressure. The system was tested for completeness of occlusion and volume of fluid lost over 10 seconds. Time, reattempts, repositioning, correctness, and difficulty score were documented. Students were surveyed before and after training regarding their experience. RESULTS Students correctly tied 75% of all knots and achieved complete occlusion of the model with 56% of knots. No difference was identified among knot types in correctness, difficulty, complete occlusion, or time to construct the knot. The first surgeon's knot placed by students had more fluid loss than the Miller's knot, but this was not true of the second knot. CONCLUSION Incomplete occlusion was common among all knot types, but students generally achieved similar knot security when placing surgeon's, Miller's, and strangle knots on a model. More surgeon's knots failed catastrophically during the first attempt, evidenced by a greater volume of fluid loss.

Thus the fluctuation of cystatin C levels might have more clinical implications than a reflection of kidney functions. Here, we summarize the latest development of studies on the pathophysiological functions of cystatin C, with focus on its immune regulatory roles at both cellular and molecular levels including antigen presentation, secretion of cytokines, synthesis of nitric oxide, as well as apoptosis.

The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins.

In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% ± 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% ± 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of α- and β-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. These results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island.

The closterovirus group combines several positive-strand RNA viruses with very flexuous filamentous particles, of which beet yellows virus (BYV) is the type virus. Closteroviruses are distinct from other RNA viruses of plants in some important phenomenological aspects. They have genomes of up to 20 kilobases (kb), a value comparable only to those of the animal coronaviruses and toroviruses, which have the largest RNA genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses. The existence of such genomes having a coding capacity several times that of an average RNA virus genome raises questions as to the trend whereby the long genomes have evolved and the possible novel functions they have acquired. The dramatic increase in the closterovirus genome coding capacity may be linked to the distinct ecological niche they occupy.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a 10-y experience from 2 institutions in patients who underwent early (<30 d) or late (>30 d) laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral injury after hysterectomy. Evaluation of the surgery included the cause of the stricture and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 9 patients with distal ureteral injury after hysterectomy were identified. All injuries were identified and treated as early as 21 d after hysterectomy. Seven of 9 patients underwent open hysterectomy, and the remaining patients had vaginal and laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. All ureteroneocystostomy cases were managed laparoscopically without conversion to open surgery and without any intraoperative complications.

The primary aim of this investigation was to expand the MOAA/S score to include truly noxious stimulation, thereby extending the dynamic range of the assessment to include sedation states consistent with deeper levels of general anaesthesia. METHODS Twenty healthy volunteers received target controlled infusions of fentanyl (target=0.8 ng ml(-1)) and propofol (starting at 0.5 µg ml(-1) and gradually increasing to 5 µg ml(-1)). At each propofol concentration, a MOAA/S score was obtained before and after tetanic electrical stimulation. The tetanic electrical stimulation current was gradually increased until the subject responded or until 50 mA was delivered without a response. A pharmacodynamic model was constructed to characterize the concentration-effect relationship between propofol and the MOAA/S scores.

Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. METHODS: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. CONCLUSION: Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded. A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients. Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions.

Pulmonary fibrosis, which may be one of the sequela caused by COVID-19, not only brings dyspnea and deterioration of lung function, but also affects patients' life because of its high mortality and poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor(FGFR) can inhibit the proliferation, activation and migration of fibroblasts by regulating the signal transduction pathway involved in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Chinese herbal formulas pose a good therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. Present study explores the intervention effect on pulmonary fibrosis of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) by screening the potential inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR. The docking models of VEGFR and FGFR were established to obtain the potential active ingredients which were filtered by the docking score. According to 2 prescriptions in the Protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(7th edition)and 9 prescriptions in Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating blight, 959 and 1 047 potential ingredients were obtained as the inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR respectively with the screening thres-hold set as eighty percent of the docking score of the initial ligands. The potential herbs were then filtered by the components with a hit rate higher than 30%, such as Scutellariae Radix, Adenophorae Radix, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Coicis Semen, etc. To discuss the rule of TCM in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, the networks of TCM-channel tropism and TCM-efficacy of the potential herbs was constructed. The potential herbs for treating pulmonary fibrosis mostly belong to lung(degree=14) and spleen(degree value=8), and the efficacy is focused on reinforcing deficiency(degree=9). Qiyin Prescription and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction contain the largest number of the potential herbs. The main symptom of COVID-19 is damp-heat stagnating in the lung, which always causes impairment of body fluid and Qi. Clinical observation shows that patients in the recovery period are mostly at the status that the remaining virus toxicity is not exhausted while the vital Qi have not recovered.

Based on a published design, we have generated several replication competent influenza A viruses carrying either fluorescent proteins or Gaussia luciferase. Reporter activity could be readily quantified in infected cultures, but the virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was more stable than viruses bearing fluorescent proteins and was therefore analyzed in detail. Quantification of Gaussia luciferase activity in the supernatants of infected culture allowed the convenient and highly sensitive detection of viral spread, and enzymatic activity correlated with the number of infectious particles released from infected cells. Furthermore, the Gaussia luciferase encoding virus allowed the sensitive quantification of the antiviral activity of the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) zanamivir and the host cell interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1–3, which are known to inhibit influenza virus entry. Finally, the virus was used to demonstrate that influenza A virus infection is sensitive to a modulator of endosomal cholesterol, in keeping with the concept that IFITMs inhibit viral entry by altering cholesterol levels in the endosomal membrane.

112090,3ekjqihf,,WHO,Acute asthma management during SARS-CoV2-pandemic 2020,,,,unk,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many medical practices in order to provide additional protection to both our patients and our healthcare providers. In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person. Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way. Problem: Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists. The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus. Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers. Practical implications: We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy. Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. METHODS: Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe, and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. RESULTS: Levels of 14 cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IFN-Î³-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, hepatocyte growth factor, monokine-induced gamma IFN, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the 5 cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IFN-Î³-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the 2 cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics calculations with a value of 0.99.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT and CRP were simultaneously measured and compared in 73 medico-surgical ICU patients according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) criteria based study groups. RESULTS: The clinical presentation of 75% cases revealed a range of systemic inflammatory responses (SIRS).

One approach to examining the mechanism responsible for the observed functional T cell suppression is to determine whether virus replication is required for its induction. To this end, mice were inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM that was inactivated with short-wave ultraviolet light, betapropiolactone or psoralen. Mice were also inoculated with live MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic or heterotypic MHV infection. Spleen cells from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with inactivated MHV-JHM yielded extremely variable in vitro proliferative responses after concanavalin A stimulation. MHV-susceptible mice exposed oronasally or intraperitoneally to virus inactivated by any of the minimum effective treatments failed to seroconvert. Immunization with psoralen-treated virus intraperitoneally in Freund's complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge, but survivors had elevated virus-specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to mock-immunized controls at two weeks post-challenge. Spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro T cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection. In contrast, MHV-JHM challenge of mice vaccinated with heterotypic live MHV-S resulted in significantly depressed in vitro T cell function. The combined data suggest that either virus replication or exposure to more concentrated antigen may be required for induction of the dramatic T cell dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of MHV-JHM infection as well as for a detectable MHV-specific humoral response.",1992,"Smith, A.

The pathogenesis of asthma involves the coordinated trafficking of inflammatory cells to the lungs and draining lymph nodes, as well as the activation of these inflammatory cells. Chemokine receptors and their ligands play a prominent role in directing the inflammation associated with allergic lung disease. T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses can be broadly categorized as being type 1 or type 2, based on the cell types present and the associated cytokines produced. Allergic lung disease is a predominately type 2-mediated disease. The chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR6, and CCR8 serve to promote the recruitment of type 2 T (T helper 2; Th2) cells, whereas CXCR3 antagonizes type 2 and promotes type 1 T (T helper 1; Th1) cells. The pathophysiologic manifestations of asthma, including excessive mucus production, eosinophilia, and airway hyperreactivity, are dependent upon the trafficking and activation of eosinophils, mast cells, and goblet cells. Roles for chemokine receptors, including CCR4, CCR2, and CXCR4, in the trafficking and activation of these cell types during allergic lung disease are discussed. Finally, the incidence of allergic lung disease is increasing, and the costs associated with it are substantial. Chemokine receptor expression and use by inflammatory cells during allergic lung disease makes chemokine receptors an attractive therapeutic target.

Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed HCoV infection in 79 cases (3.8%): 33 HCoV‐229E (1.6%), 13 HCoV‐NL63 (0.6%), 11 HCoV‐OC43 (0.5%), none HCoV‐HKU1 genotype A, and 22 (1.1%) co‐detections of a HCoV and another respiratory virus. The HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection; there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single HCoV infections and HCoV co‐infections. Diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients, and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain. There were a few cases of other members of the households of HCoV‐positive children falling ill during the 5–7 days following enrollment. These findings suggest that HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐OC43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts, and the HCoV‐NL63 identified recently does not seem to be any different.

Thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein is not unique among structural proteins of coronaviruses. However, SARS-CoV membrane protein seems to be more sensitive to heat treatment, since the membrane protein of MHV-JHM, another member of the Coronaviridae, would not aggregate after the same treatment. Therefore, if SARS-CoV membrane protein needs to be analyzed using SDS-PAGE, boiling should be avoided.

Mode of surfactant administration has evolved towards less invasive technique in the last few years. We randomised 58 preterm infants of 28–34 weeks of gestation with RDS within 6 h of birth to receive surfactant by InSurE or minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was used as primary respiratory support. The main objective was to compare the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in first 72 h of life and secondarily hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (> grade 2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and composite outcome of BPD/mortality. We did not find any difference in need of IMV in first 72 h between MIST and InSurE (relative risk with MIST, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 1.32). No difference was observed in terms of hs PDA, IVH (> grade 2), BPD and composite outcome of BPD/mortality. Conclusion: There is no difference between MIST and InSurE in preterm neonates with RDS with NIPPV as a primary mode of respiratory support.

114048,fmmm8itx,,WHO,Pediatric COVID-19: Systematic review of the literature,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: There is limited data regarding the demographics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data. RESULTS: Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1â¯day to 17â¯years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5â¯ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1â¯year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.0018%. CONCLUSION: In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

A variety of techniques have been described to treat URFs, and the laparoscopic approach has been approved as an efficient tool for even some complex fistulas. We aimed to report our laparoscopic experience for complex URF repair with special emphasis on salvage prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included four men (59-75 years), with laparoscopic repair for complex URFs. URF developed after transurethral resection of the prostate in patients 2 and 3 and after radical prostatectomy in patient 4. Patient 1 had received combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the rectal carcinoma; a prostatic abscess developed that resulted at the end in URF. Laparoscopic salvage prostatectomy was performed for patients 1 and 2. A transvesical laparoscopic approach was performed for patient 3, and a transperitoneal transvesical technique was performed for patient 4. A tunica vaginalis flap was used for patient 1, and peritoneal interposition flaps were developed in patients 2 and 4 mL, and no patients needed intraoperative blood transfusion. Postoperative hospital stay was 12 to 34 days. The urethral catheter was removed on postoperative day 11 to 32, and cystography showed no leakage of contrast except in patient 1.

This technique may alleviate some of the technical limitations that a surgeon faces with a laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal anastomosis (EA). METHODS A retrospective chart review of 195 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy by four colorectal surgeons at three institutions from March 2005 to June 2014 was performed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare postoperative and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS A total of 195 patients underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy over the study period, with 86 (44 %) patients receiving IA and 109 (56 %) patients receiving an EA. The most common indication for surgery in both groups was cancer: 56 (65 %) of IA cases and 57 (52 %) of EA cases. IA had a significantly higher rate of minor complications but no difference in serious complications compared to EA. Conversion to open resection was higher in EA. Using multivariate analysis to compare IA versus EA, there was no significant difference in length of stay, return of bowel function, risk of anastomotic leak, risk of intraabdominal abscess or risk of wound complications. Amongst cancer resections, there was no significant difference in the median number of lymph nodes harvested (18 LNs in IA group vs. 19 LNs in EA group, P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in overall survival and disease-free survival at 5.7 years between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS IA in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy is associated with similar postoperative and oncologic outcomes compared to EA. IA may possess advantages in terms of conversion and flexibility of specimen extraction, but this is counterbalanced by a higher incidence of minor complications.

We hypothesize that patients with COVID‐19 may develop a hypermetabolic state which may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands in patients with COVID‐19. METHOD: Resting energy expenditure (REE), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured by indirect calorimetry on seven critically ill patients with COVID‐19. RESULTS: The median measured REE was 4044 Kcal/day which was 235.7% ± 51.7% of predicted. The median VCO2 was 452 mL/min (range 295–582 mL/min) and the median VO2 was 585 mL/min (range 416–798 mL/min). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with COVID‐19 are in an extreme hypermetabolic state. This may explain the high failure rates for mechanical ventilation for these patients and highlights the potential need for increased nutritional requirements for such patients.

The infections were investigated by recording clinical data, cytokine expression of peripheral blood cells and pathology. Twelve calves were included in the study: Three animals were exposed to H. somnus only, and two to M. dispar only, whereas five were challenged to M. dispar followed by exposure to H. somnus 11–14 days later. Also, one calf was exposed to M. dispar followed by exposure to a sterile saline solution 11 days later, and one calf was only exposed to a sterile saline solution. Just one animal, only challenged with H. somnus, developed a focal necrotizing pneumonia, from which H. somnus was isolated. Thus, the ability of H. somnus and M. dispar to act as primary pathogens under these conditions were minimal and inconsistent. However, a transient rise in body temperature, a marked granulocytosis and increased levels of interleukin-8 in peripheral blood after inoculation with H. somnus indicated a clear systemic response, probably as a consequence of the natural non-specific local and systemic defence mechanisms acting in healthy calves.",2000-03-15,"Tegtmeier, C.; Angen, Ø.; Grell, S.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its control efforts require social actions and behaviours, all of which place a large reliance on individual and community compliance, highlighting the need for appropriate community engagement to support such work. However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities within COVID-19 thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation of community engagement within COVID-19 response. Methodology A rapid evidence review was conducted to identity how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases (PubMed, CINHAL and Scopus) were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS and H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language, though articles must have detailed a minimum of one community engagement for infection prevention and control initiative. All authors participated in searching, screening, and data extraction, with a minimum of two authors at each stage. Results From 1,112 references identified in our search, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria. All but 3 articles were published on or after 2015 which details 37 community engagement initiatives for Ebola (n=28), Zika (n=5) and H1N1 (n=4). Twenty-seven of these initiatives were implemented in low-income countries and 10 from high-income countries. Six broad community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility or community health committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These actors worked across six different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust-building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. Leaders were the most prevalent actor being engaged, and behaviour change communication, risk communication, and surveillance and tracing were the most common function of community engagement. Implementation considerations community engagement in prevention and control of COVID-19 are reported within. Conclusion COVID-19 global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and support equity-informed responses. Previous experience from outbreaks shows that community engagement can take many forms and include different actors and approaches who support various prevention and control activities. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures, and utilise community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.",2020-06-19,"Gilmore, B.; Ndejjo, R.; Tchetchia, A.; de Claro, V.; Nyamupachitu-Mago, E.; Diallo, A.

This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. METHODS: A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. RESULTS: There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control. After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase.

SVA was originally identified as a cell culture contaminant and was not associated with disease until 2007 when it was first observed in pigs with Idiopathic Vesicular Disease (IVD). Vesicular disease is sporadically observed in swine, is not debilitating, but is significant due to its resemblance to foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), whose presence would be economically devastating to the United States. IVD disrupts swine production until foreign animal diseases can be ruled out. Identification and characterization of SVA as a cause of IVD will help to quickly rule out infection by foreign animal diseases. METHODS: We have developed and characterized an indirect ELISA assay to specifically identify serum antibodies to SVA. Viral protein 1, 2 and 3 (VP1, VP2, VP3) were expressed, isolated, and purified from E. coli and used to coat plates for an indirect ELISA. Sera from pigs with and without IVD symptoms as well as a time course following animals from an infected farm, were analyzed to determine the antibody responses to VP1, VP2, and VP3. RESULTS: Antibody responses to VP2 were higher than VP1 and VP3 and showed high affinity binding on an avidity ELISA. ROC analysis of the SVA VP2 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 89.7%. Compared to IFA, the quantitative ELISA showed an 89% agreement in negative samples and positive samples from 4–60 days after appearance of clinical signs. Immune sera positive for FMDV, encephalomyocarditis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus antibodies did not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS: A simple ELISA based on detection of antibodies to SVA VP2 will help to differentially diagnose IVD due to SVA and rule out the presence of economically devastating foreign animal diseases.",2017-02-15,"Dvorak, Cheryl M.

METHODS: Databases (Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched electronically on 6th April and updated regularly until 8th June 2020. Reports of pregnant women with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were included. Meta-analytical proportion summaries and meta-regression analyses for key clinical outcomes are provided. FINDINGS: 86 studies were included, 17 studies (2567 pregnancies) in the quantitative synthesis; other small case series and case reports were used to extract rarely-reported events and outcome. Most women (73.9%) were in the third trimester; 52.4% have delivered, half by caesarean section (48.3%). The proportion of Black, Asian or minority ethnic group membership (50.8%); obesity (38.2%), and chronic co-morbidities (32.5%) were high. The most commonly reported clinical symptoms were fever (63.3%), cough (71.4%) and dyspnoea (34.4%). The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised CRP or procalcitonin (54.0%), lymphopenia (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%). Preterm birth before 37 weeks’ gestation was common (21.8%), usually medically-indicated (18.4%). Maternal intensive care unit admission was required in 7.0%, with intubation in 3.4%. Maternal mortality was uncommon (~1%). Maternal intensive care admission was higher in cohorts with higher rates of co-morbidities (beta=0.007, p<0.05) and maternal age over 35 years (beta=0.007, p<0.01). Maternal mortality was higher in cohorts with higher rates of antiviral drug use (beta=0.03, p<0.001), likely due to residual confounding. Neonatal nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was positive in 1.4%. INTERPRETATION: The risk of iatrogenic preterm birth and caesarean delivery was increased. The available evidence is reassuring, suggesting that maternal morbidity is similar to that of women of reproductive age. Vertical transmission of the virus probably occurs, albeit in a small proportion of cases.

106062,aui69e2h,,WHO,How the COVID-19 pandemic may impact public support for clinical xenotransplantation in the United States?,,,,unk,"Many patients who would undergo organ transplantation cannot proceed due to the inability of human organ donation to satisfy medical needs. Xenotransplantation has the potential to offer unlimited availability of pig organs for transplantation, and pig-to-non-human primate models have demonstrated outcomes that may soon justify clinical trials. However, one of the unique ethical challenges faced by xenotransplantation is that the risk of introducing potential zoonotic disease into the community must be weighed along with the benefit to the patient. While most experts believe that zoonosis is manageable, apprehension over disease transmission from animal donors to human recipients remains a frequent concern of many who are undecided or opposed to clinical xenotransplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a scenario (rapid worldwide spread of a highly contagious novel zoonotic disease with no natural defense in humans) that would seem to justify apprehension, especially in the United States, which has largely avoided previous pandemic outbreaks. However, there are many differences between zoonosis found in the wild or after xenotransplantation that favor the safety of the latter. Still, these differences, as well as the benefits of xenotransplantation, are not widely understood outside of the field. We must therefore ask what impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on attitudes toward xenotransplantation.",2020,"Knoll, Michael F; Cooper, David K C; Bottino, Rita",Xenotransplantation,,#619805,,,,,220257473.0,en,patient undergo organ transplantation proceed inability human organ donation satisfy medical need xenotransplantation potential offer unlimited availability pig organ transplantation pig-to-non-human primate model demonstrate outcome soon justify clinical trial unique ethical challenge face xenotransplantation risk introduce potential zoonotic disease community weigh benefit patient expert believe zoonosis manageable apprehension disease transmission animal donor human recipient remain frequent concern undecided oppose clinical xenotransplantation covid-19 pandemic represent scenario rapid worldwide spread highly contagious novel zoonotic disease natural defense human justify apprehension especially united states largely avoid previous pandemic outbreak difference zoonosis find wild xenotransplantation favor safety difference good benefit xenotransplantation widely understand outside field ask impact covid-19 pandemic attitude xenotransplantation,107

During virus replication, a 3' coterminal nested set of five to eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are made that are also 5' coterminal with the genome, because they carry the genomic leader as the result of discontinuous transcription at intergenic donor signals during (-)-strand synthesis when templates for sgmRNA synthesis are made. An unanswered question is whether the sgmRNAs, which appear rapidly and abundantly, undergo posttranscriptional amplification. Here, using RT-PCR and sequence analyses of head-to-tail-ligated (-) strands, we show that after transfection of an in vitro-generated marked sgmRNA into virus-infected cells, the sgmRNA, like the genome, can function as a template for (-)-strand synthesis. Furthermore, when the transfected sgmRNA contains an internally placed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase template-switching donor signal, discontinuous transcription occurs at this site, and a shorter, 3' terminally nested leader-containing sgmRNA is made, as evidenced by its leader-body junction and by the expression of a GFP gene. Thus, in principle, the longer-nested sgmRNAs in a natural infection, all of which contain potential internal template-switching donor signals, can function to increase the number of the shorter 3'-nested sgmRNAs. One predicted advantage of this behavior for coronavirus survivability is an increased chance of maintaining genome fitness in the 3' one-third of the genome via a homologous recombination between the (now independently abundant) WT sgmRNA and a defective genome.",2010,"Wu, Hung-Yi; Brian, David A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1000378107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562343/,7197642.0,en,coronaviruses possess large know rna genome 27- 32-kb (+)-strand molecule replicate cytoplasm virus replication 3 coterminal nest set subgenomic sg mrnas 5 coterminal genome carry genomic leader result discontinuous transcription intergenic donor signal (-)-strand synthesis template sgmrna synthesis unanswered question sgmrnas appear rapidly abundantly undergo posttranscriptional amplification use rt-pcr sequence analysis head-to-tail-ligated strand transfection vitro-generated mark sgmrna virus-infected cell sgmrna like genome function template (-)-strand synthesis furthermore transfect sgmrna contain internally place rna-dependent rna polymerase template-switching donor signal discontinuous transcription occur site short 3 terminally nest leader-containing sgmrna evidence leader-body junction expression gfp gene principle longer-nested sgmrnas natural infection contain potential internal template-switching donor signal function increase numb short 3'-nested sgmrnas predict advantage behavior coronavirus survivability increase chance maintain genome fitness 3 one-third genome homologous recombination independently abundant wt sgmrna defective genome,132

80842,937qmgxg,,Medline,Human norovirus infection and the lessons from animal caliciviruses.,,,15353967,unk,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Human noroviruses are a major cause of infectious intestinal disease, particularly in the health sector, with considerable knock-on effects on care provision through ward closures and staff sickness. This review will describe recent advances in our understanding of human noroviruses. In addition, we will consider related nonhuman caliciviruses to highlight some potential difficulties in the control of caliciviral disease. RECENT FINDINGS Using more sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based assays, noroviruses are now recognized as the most common cause of infectious intestinal disease in the community, as well as outbreaks of the infectious intestinal disease. After recovery from acute disease, some individuals continue shedding norovirus, particularly if immunosuppressed. The noroviruses are extremely variable, which has important implications for protection following challenge, and for future vaccination. From amongst this variability, new strains have emerged with the potential to spread widely. Recently a mouse norovirus has been identified which will afford new insights into the biology of these important viruses. Studies on human susceptibility have identified some resistant individuals in the population and a potential virus receptor, which may lead to the development of novel antiviral therapies. SUMMARY Lack of cell culture systems for the human noroviruses is being overcome by molecular technologies. Such studies have provided new insight into the significance and epidemiology of these viruses and opened the possibility of disease control through vaccination. Work on nonhuman caliciviruses has interesting parallels with human noroviruses, and provides new insights into the understanding of these important human pathogens.",2004,"Radford, Alan D; Gaskell, Rosalind M; Hart, C Anthony",Current opinion in infectious diseases,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15353967/,28753830.0,en,purpose review human noroviruses major cause infectious intestinal disease particularly health sector considerable knock-on effect care provision ward closure staff sickness review describe recent advance understand human noroviruses addition consider relate nonhuman calicivirus highlight potential difficulty control caliciviral disease recent findings sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction base assay noroviruses recognize common cause infectious intestinal disease community good outbreak infectious intestinal disease recovery acute disease individual continue shed norovirus particularly immunosuppressed noroviruses extremely variable important implication protection follow challenge future vaccination variability new strain emerge potential spread widely recently mouse norovirus identify afford new insight biology important virus studies human susceptibility identify resistant individual population potential virus receptor lead development novel antiviral therapy summary lack cell culture system human noroviruses overcome molecular technology study provide new insight significance epidemiology virus open possibility disease control vaccination work nonhuman calicivirus interest parallel human noroviruses provide new insight understand important human pathogen,149

Studies on the related murine norovirus (MNV) have demonstrated the importance of an interferon (IFN) response in host control of virus replication, but this remains unclear for HuNoVs. Despite the lack of an efficient cell culture infection system, transfection of stool-isolated NV RNA into mammalian cells leads to viral RNA replication and virus production. Using this system, we show here that NV RNA replication is sensitive to type I (α/β) and III (interleukin-29 [IL-29]) IFN treatment. However, in cells capable of a strong IFN response to Sendai virus (SeV) and poly(I·C), NV RNA replicates efficiently and generates double-stranded RNA without inducing a detectable IFN response. Replication of HuNoV genogroup GII.3 strain U201 RNA, generated from a reverse genetics system, also does not induce an IFN response. Consistent with a lack of IFN induction, NV RNA replication is enhanced neither by neutralization of type I/III IFNs through neutralizing antibodies or the soluble IFN decoy receptor B18R nor by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in the IFN induction pathways. In contrast to other positive-strand RNA viruses that block IFN induction by targeting MAVS for degradation, MAVS is not degraded in NV RNA-replicating cells, and an SeV-induced IFN response is not blocked. Together, these results indicate that HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian cells does not induce an IFN response, suggesting that the epithelial IFN response may play a limited role in host restriction of HuNoV replication. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Due to lack of an efficient cell culture system and robust small-animal model, little is known about the innate host defense to these viruses. Studies on murine norovirus (MNV) have shown the importance of an interferon (IFN) response in host control of MNV replication, but this remains unclear for HuNoVs. Here, we investigated the IFN response to HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian cells using Norwalk virus stool RNA transfection, a reverse genetics system, IFN neutralization reagents, and shRNA knockdown methods. Our results show that HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian epithelial cells does not induce an IFN response, nor can it be enhanced by blocking the IFN response. These results suggest a limited role of the epithelial IFN response in host control of HuNoV RNA replication, providing important insights into our understanding of the host defense to HuNoVs that differs from that to MNV.",2016,"Qu, Lin; Murakami, Kosuke; Broughman, James R; Lay, Margarita K; Guix, Susana; Tenge, Victoria R; Atmar, Robert L; Estes, Mary K",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01425-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466422/,12916020.0,en,unlabelled human noroviruses hunovs prototype strain norwalk virus nv lead cause acute gastroenteritis outbreak worldwide studies relate murine norovirus mnv demonstrate importance interferon ifn response host control virus replication remain unclear hunovs despite lack efficient cell culture infection system transfection stool-isolated nv rna mammalian cell lead viral rna replication virus production system nv rna replication sensitive type α/β iii interleukin-29 il-29 ifn treatment cell capable strong ifn response sendai virus sev poly(i·c nv rna replicate efficiently generate double-stranded rna induce detectable ifn response replication hunov genogroup gii.3 strain u201 rna generate reverse genetic system doe induce ifn response consistent lack ifn induction nv rna replication enhance neutralization type i/iii ifns neutralize antibody soluble ifn decoy receptor b18r short hairpin rna shrna knockdown mitochondrial antiviral signal protein mavs interferon regulatory factor 3 irf3 ifn induction pathway contrast positive-strand rna virus block ifn induction target mavs degradation mavs degrade nv rna-replicating cell sev-induced ifn response block result indicate hunov rna replication mammalian cell doe induce ifn response suggest epithelial ifn response play limit role host restriction hunov replication importance human noroviruses hunovs lead cause epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide lack efficient cell culture system robust small-animal model little know innate host defense virus studies murine norovirus mnv importance interferon ifn response host control mnv replication remain unclear hunovs investigate ifn response hunov rna replication mammalian cell use norwalk virus stool rna transfection reverse genetic system ifn neutralization reagent shrna knockdown method result hunov rna replication mammalian epithelial cell doe induce ifn response enhance block ifn response result suggest limit role epithelial ifn response host control hunov rna replication provide important insight understand host defense hunovs differ mnv,273

For example, for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), how is a case defined? Hubei province in China changed its case definition twice in a fortnight-from laboratory-confirmed cases to clinically-confirmed cases without laboratory tests, and back to laboratory-confirmed cases. This caused confusion in the reported number of cases. If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested? Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only ""suspected cases"" are laboratory-tested in most countries. This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a ""suspect case"" defined? With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase. What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing? This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration).

In this study, we investigated the potential interactions between PRRSV nsps by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and pull-down assays. Our analyses revealed a complex network of interactions involving most of PRRSV nsps. Among them, nsp9 and nsp12 were identified as the hubs of the nsp interactome; transmembrane proteins nsp2 and nsp5 both interacted with nsp3, indicating that the three membrane-bound proteins might bind together to form the scaffold to support the association of RTCs with the intracellular membrane.

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor.

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs.

While the acute phase of infection is mostly asymptomatic, this virus has the high propensity to establish persistence and in the course of one to several decades liver disease can develop. HCV is a paradigm for the complex interplay between the interferon (IFN) system and viral countermeasures. The virus induces an IFN response within the infected cell and is rather sensitive against the antiviral state triggered by IFNs, yet in most cases HCV persists. Numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been reported to suppress HCV replication, but in only a few cases we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying antiviral activity. It is becoming increasingly clear that blockage of viral replication is mediated by the concerted action of multiple ISGs that target different steps of the HCV replication cycle.

PATIENTS Twenty-one HIV-seropositive patients (13 asymptomatic and eight with diarrhoea) and 12 controls from an urban referral-based tertiary care centre in Berlin who underwent duodenoscopy. METHODS A new miniaturized Ussing chamber allowed measurements on duodenal forceps biopsies. Epithelial barrier function was characterized by alternating current impedance analysis, which allows differentiation of epithelial and subepithelial resistance and by 3H-lactulose and 3H-mannitol flux measurements. Na+-glucose cotransport was quantified as phlorizin-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) and active ion secretion by baseline and bumetanide-sensitive Isc. RESULTS Duodenal biopsies from asymptomatic HIV-infected patients were no different from controls, whereas biopsies from HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea showed a decrease in epithelial resistance from 21.2+/-1.9 to 12.9+/-1.3 omega cm2 (P<0.01). Concomitantly, mucosal-to-serosal lactulose flux increased from 0.29+/-0.02 to 0.40+/-0.03 micromol (hcm2) (P<0.01). Phlorizin-sensitive Isc indicating Na+-glucose cotransport, as well as baseline and bumetanide-sensitive Isc indicating active electrogenic chloride secretion were not different between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS A miniaturized Ussing device was developed for electrophysiological investigations of duodenal forceps biopsies, which allowed characterization of active ion transport mechanisms and epithelial barrier function. Duodenum of HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea showed no evidence for active ion secretion or Na+-glucose malabsorption, but showed an impaired epithelial barrier function, which could contribute to diarrhoea by a leak flux mechanism.",1998,"Stockmann, M; Fromm, M; Schmitz, H; Schmidt, W; Riecken, E O; Schulzke, J D",AIDS,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9456254/,43890510.0,en,objectives characterize diarrhoeal mechanism hiv-infected patient epithelial transport barrier function duodenal mucosa investigate vitro patients twenty-one hiv-seropositive patient 13 asymptomatic diarrhoea 12 control urban referral-based tertiary care centre berlin undergo duodenoscopy methods new miniaturize ussing chamber allow measurement duodenal forcep biopsy epithelial barrier function characterize alternate current impedance analysis allow differentiation epithelial subepithelial resistance 3h-lactulose 3h-mannitol flux measurement na+-glucose cotransport quantify phlorizin-sensitive short circuit current isc active ion secretion baseline bumetanide-sensitive isc results duodenal biopsy asymptomatic hiv-infected patient different control biopsy hiv-infected patient diarrhoea decrease epithelial resistance 21.2+/-1.9 12.9+/-1.3 omega cm2 p<0.01 concomitantly mucosal-to-serosal lactulose flux increase 0.29+/-0.02 0.40+/-0.03 micromol hcm2 p<0.01 phlorizin-sensitive isc indicate na+-glucose cotransport good baseline bumetanide-sensitive isc indicate active electrogenic chloride secretion different group conclusions miniaturize ussing device develope electrophysiological investigation duodenal forcep biopsy allow characterization active ion transport mechanism epithelial barrier function duodenum hiv-infected patient diarrhoea evidence active ion secretion na+-glucose malabsorption impair epithelial barrier function contribute diarrhoea leak flux mechanism,156

At present, no effective pulmonary therapy for A-T exists. Cell therapy using adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) might be a promising approach for tissue regeneration. The aim of the present project was to investigate whether ASCs migrate into the injured lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice as an indication of incipient tissue damage during A-T. Therefore, ASCs isolated from luciferase transgenic mice (mASCs) were intravenously transplanted into Atm-deficient and wild-type mice. Retention kinetics of the cells were monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and completed by subsequent verification using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The in vivo imaging and the qPCR results demonstrated migration accompanied by a significantly longer retention time of transplanted mASCs in the lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice compared to wild type mice.

METHODS Synovial fluid and serum was collected from 88 patients who underwent revision arthroplasty surgery. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society definition was used to classify these patients into 2 groups: 36 PJIs and 52 aseptic failures. Synovial fluid and serum samples were tested for 9 biomarkers using a micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic polymorphisms were evaluated with polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease analysis. RESULTS Synovial fluid-derived IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-17, CRP, GCSF, TNFα, and serum-derived IL-6, IL-17, ferritin, CRP were found suitable to classify PJI and aseptic failure. In addition, IL-17 and CRP levels demonstrated a positive correlation between synovial fluid and serum. TNFα-238, IL6-174, GCSF3R, and IL1 RN-VNTR genetic polymorphisms occurred more frequently in individuals with septic failure. CONCLUSION Significant differences between the two groups were observed in the functional polymorphisms of the genes encoding the cytokines investigated. These differences could be interpreted as indicating that there is an association between PJI and genetic polymorphisms.

Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe “irreversible” radiological bronchiectasis.

Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however, difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually increasing prevalence of the ``Cultural identity'' frame. By examining specific topics and sentiments, we identify characteristics and dynamics of each frame. Finally, as a case study, we delve into the framing of mass shootings, revealing three major framing patterns.

We demonstrate our system can sense viral derived sequences with high sensitivity and specificity, and can be utilized to directly detect viruses from infected plant material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the entire system can operate using only body heat and naked-eye visual analysis of outputs.

Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic.

Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet unknown. METHODS This study was performed in the post-PCV7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). Conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At baseline, Haemophilus influenzae (41%), Staphylococcus aureus (40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). Most pneumococci were non-PCV7 serotypes. Viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21%). Most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low.

Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and recovering individuals are more prone to suffer additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, concussion management faces two significant challenges: there are no objective, clinically accepted, brain-based approaches for determining (i) whether an athlete has suffered a concussion, and (ii) when the athlete has recovered. Diagnosis is based on clinical testing and self-reporting of symptoms and their severity. Self-reporting is highly subjective and symptoms only indirectly reflect the underlying brain injury. Here, we introduce a deep learning Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between healthy and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only a short (i.e. 90 seconds long) sample of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor subjected to a stimulus during data collection, and the acquired EEG data was neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and tested on data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, bench marked against 35 healthy, adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of >90% and its ensemble-median Area Under the Curve (AUC) corresponds to 0.971.

CROSSalign is based on the combination of the Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS) algorithm to predict the RNA secondary structure profile at single-nucleotide resolution and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method to align profiles of different lengths. We applied CROSSalign to investigate the structural conservation of long non-coding RNAs such as XIST and HOTAIR as well as ssRNA viruses including HIV. CROSSalign performs pair-wise comparisons and is able to find homologs between thousands of matches identifying the exact regions of similarity between profiles of different lengths. In a pool of sequences with the same secondary structure CROSSalign accurately recognizes repeat A of XIST and domain D2 of HOTAIR and outperforms other methods based on covariance modeling.

Although SARS is etiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and functional cell receptor has been identified, the pathogenesis of the virus infection is largely unclear. METHODS The clinical specimens were processed and analyzed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in-house. Further investigations of target antigen included reviews of phage display technique, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, protein expression and purification, Western blotting validation, serological and immunohistochemical staining in postmortem tissue. RESULTS A type of medium or low titer anti-lung tissue antibodies were found in the sera of SARS patients at the early stage of the disease. Human long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) gene endonuclease (EN) domain protein was one of the target autoantigens and it was aberrantly expressed in the lung tissue of SARS patients.

Another major enzyme encoded by many viruses is a protease responsible for the processing of virus-encoded polyproteins. The HIV protease has been very successfully targeted, and hepatitis C virus and rhinovirus protease inhibitors are being actively developed.

With the protocols described in this chapter, a laboratory with skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry can readily identify peptides in the library that bind selectively, and with micromolar affinity, to a given target protein on the time scale of 2 months. To illustrate this approach, we use a library of bacteriophage M13 particles, which display 12-mer combinatorial peptides, to affinity select different peptide ligands for two different targets, the SH3 domain of the human Lyn protein tyrosine kinase and a segment of the yeast serine/threonine protein kinase Cbk1.

In this study we report that LP-DCs in unperturbed mice require CCR7 to migrate to MLNs. In vitro, LP-DCs expressing CCR7 migrated toward CCL21, although the LP-DCs appeared morphologically and phenotypically immature.

Interestingly, CCR7+ DCs in MLNs with the unique LP-DC phenotype had numerous vacuoles containing cellular debris in the cytoplasm, although MLN-DCs themselves were poorly phagocytic, suggesting that the debris was derived from the LP, where the LP-DCs ingested apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Consistent with this, LP-DCs ingested IECs vigorously in vitro. By presenting IEC-associated Ag, the LP-DCs also induce T cells to produce IL-4 and IL-10.

Safety and short-term angiographic effectiveness of this device have recently been reported. However, long-term angiographic results are lacking. We report herein the 18 months' angiographic outcome in patients treated for a wide-neck intracranial aneurysm with the MED. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen patients (17 female, mean age 50 years) with 20 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms (six ruptured; 14 unruptured) were treated by the MED between January 2015 and June 2016. Procedure-related complications were systematically recorded; discharge and 6-9 months' follow-up modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed. Angiographic mid-term and long-term follow-up were performed with a mean delay of 6.4±1.5 months (n=16 aneurysms) and 17.7±4.2 months (n=15 aneurysms), respectively. Occlusion rates were evaluated after the procedure and at the mid-term and long-term follow-up using the Roy-Raymond scale. RESULTS Embolization with the MED was feasible in all except two cases (2/20, 10%). One per-procedural perforation was recorded (1/20, 5%) and one MED deployment failed because of the aneurysm's shape (1/20, 5%). Three cases of thromboembolic complications were observed (3/20, 15%). Only one thromboembolic complication was responsible for clinical sequelae. Grade A occlusion rate was 61% (11/18) after the procedure, 75% at 6 months' follow-up (12/16), and 80% (12/15) at long-term follow-up. Two cases (2/18, 11%) of recanalization at mid-term were documented angiographically. No recanalization occurred between the mid-term and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION MED is a hybrid embolization device, combining properties of a conventional coil with those of an intrasaccular flow disrupter. Our series focusing on long-term angiographic follow-up shows a satisfactory long-term occlusion rate.

Liver impairment of unknown cause is present in 29% of patients with A(H7N9) infection, some of whom experience severe liver injury. Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is a type of acute severe liver injury characterized by an abrupt, massive increase in serum aminotransferases resulting from anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the prevalence of HH is ∼1%–2%. Here, we report a 1.8% (2/112) incidence of HH in the largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection. Both HH patients presented with multiple organ failure (MOF) involving respiratory, cardiac, circulatory and renal failure and had a history of chronic heart disease. On admission, severe liver impairment was found. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were 937 and 1281 U/L, and 3117 and 3029 U/L, respectively, in the two patients. Unfortunately, both patients died due to deterioration of MOF. A post-mortem biopsy in case 1 confirmed the presence of centrilobular necrosis of the liver, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of A(H7N9)-specific genes was negative, which excluded A(H7N9)-related hepatitis. The incidence of HH in A(H7N9) patients is similar to that in ICU patients with other aetiologies.

The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents.

As the number of coronavirus infections has exceeded 100,000 with toll deaths of about 5000 worldwide as of early March, 2020, scientists and researchers are racing to investigate the nature of this virus and evaluate the short and long term effects of this disease. Despite its negative impacts that obliged the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the rate of mortality of this infection has not exceeded 3.4% globally. On the other hand, the mortality rate caused by ambient air pollution has contributed to 7.6% of all deaths in 2016 worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced China to lockdown its industrial activities and hence dropped its NO2 and carbon emissions by 30 and 25%, respectively. This work reports on the first case study that compares the air quality status before and after the crisis. It sheds light on the facts related to the demographics of deaths by gender, age and health status before infection. The historical data on air quality, estimates of annual deaths and its economic burden have been presented and analyzed. The actual daily deaths due to COVID-19 have been obtained from the official records of the daily Situation Reports published by World Health Organization as of March 11th. The rate of mortality due to COVID-19 was impacted by two factors: age and health status. Results show that 75% of deaths were related to cases that had underlying present diseases with the majority aged of 80+ years. The reported figures were compared with the average daily mortality due to poor air quality which reached up to 3287 deaths due to high levels of NO2, O3 and PM.

Differential cellular transcriptome was examined using Affymetrix exon chips representing 28,536 transcripts, and after statistical analyses 66 cellular genes were shown to be upregulated and 104 genes were downregulated by nsp11. These genes were grouped into 5 major signaling pathways according to their functional relations: histone-related, cell cycle and DNA replication, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling, complement, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Of these, the modulation of cell cycle by nsp11 was further investigated since many of the regulated genes fell in this particular pathway.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents' expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours.

Health issues, particularly infectious diseases, are potential threats for the species. Health information from 65 wild tapirs from two Brazilian biomes, Atlantic Forest (AF) and Pantanal (PA), were collected during a long-term study (1996-2012). The study included physic, hematologic and biochemical evaluations, microbiologic cultures, urinalysis, and serologic analyses for antibodies against 13 infectious agents (viral and bacterial). The AF and PA tapirs were significantly different for several hematologic and biochemical parameters. Ten bacteria taxa were identified in the AF and 26 in the PA. Antibodies against five viruses were detected: Bluetongue virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, and porcine parvovirus. A high prevalence of exposure to Leptospira interrogans (10 serovars: Autumnalis, Bratislava, Canicola, Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Hebdomadis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, and Pyrogenes) was detected in both the AF and PA sites. A greater diversity of serovars and higher antibody titers were found in the PA. Statistically significant differences between sites were found for L. interrogans, equine encephalitis virus, and porcine parvovirus. Based on physical evaluations, both AF and PA populations were healthy.

Standard treatment in these patients is to preserve the anal sphincter with restoration of intestinal function by mechanical colorectal anastomosis or coloanal anastomosis, and to maintain genitourinary function by preservation of hypogastric nerves. METHODS In order to emphasize the importance of this surgical technique in the Fourth Surgical Clinic of the CF Clinical Hospital Cluj-Napoca, we conducted a prospective observational interventional study over a 3-year period (2013-2016) in 165 patients hospitalized for rectal and rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma in various disease stages, who underwent Dixon surgery using the two techniques of manual and mechanical end-to-end anastomosis. For mechanical anastomosis, we used Covidien and Panther circular staplers. The patients were assigned to two groups, group A in which Dixon surgery with manual end-to-end anastomosis was performed (116 patients), and group B in which Dixon surgery with mechanical end-to-end anastomosis was carried out (49 patients). RESULTS Mechanical anastomosis allowed to restore intestinal continuity following low anterior resection in 21 patients with lower rectal adenocarcinoma compared to 2 patients in whom intestinal continuity was restored by manual anastomosis, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.000001). The double-row mechanical suture technique is associated with a reduced duration of surgery (121.67 minutes for Dixon surgery with mechanical anastomosis, compared to 165.931 minutes for Dixon surgery with manual anastomosis, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION The use of circular transanal staplers facilitates end-to-end anastomosis by double-row mechanical suture, allowing to perform low anterior resection in situations when the restoration of intestinal continuity by manual anastomosis is technically not possible, with the aim to preserve the anal sphincter, to restore intestinal function and maintain genitourinary function through preservation of hypogastric nerves.",2017,"Cheregi, Cornel Dragos; Simon, Ioan; Fabian, Ovidiu; Maghiar, Adrian",Clujul medical,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.15386/cjmed-787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28781527/,26623691.0,en,background aims colorectal cancer frequent digestive malignancy 3 cause death cancer despite early diagnosis therapeutic progress past year standard treatment patient preserve anal sphincter restoration intestinal function mechanical colorectal anastomosis coloanal anastomosis maintain genitourinary function preservation hypogastric nerve methods order emphasize importance surgical technique fourth surgical clinic cf clinical hospital cluj-napoca conduct prospective observational interventional study 3-year period 2013 2016 165 patient hospitalize rectal rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma disease stage undergo dixon surgery use technique manual mechanical end-to-end anastomosis mechanical anastomosis use covidien panther circular stapler patient assign group group dixon surgery manual end-to-end anastomosis perform 116 patient group b dixon surgery mechanical end-to-end anastomosis carry 49 patient results mechanical anastomosis allow restore intestinal continuity follow low anterior resection 21 patient low rectal adenocarcinoma compare 2 patient intestinal continuity restore manual anastomosis statistically significant difference p<0.000001 double-row mechanical suture technique associate reduce duration surgery 121.67 minute dixon surgery mechanical anastomosis compare 165.931 minute dixon surgery manual anastomosis p<0.0001 conclusion use circular transanal stapler facilitate end-to-end anastomosis double-row mechanical suture allow perform low anterior resection situation restoration intestinal continuity manual anastomosis technically possible aim preserve anal sphincter restore intestinal function maintain genitourinary function preservation hypogastric nerve,193

In this report, we examined the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery through a single incision using a flexible endoscope in a clinical setting. Specifically, we performed cholecystectomy using single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic (SIMPLE) surgery. METHODS Thirteen patients with cholecystolithiasis or gallbladder polyp underwent SIMPLE cholecystectomy using a newly developed short-type flexible endoscope with a working length of 60 cm. Twenty-seven patients underwent standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a 5-mm rigid laparoscope. We retrospectively compared the surgical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the short-type flexible endoscope was successfully carried out. No gallbladder perforation occurred, but perforation occurred in four cases in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Although no other surgical outcomes differed between the two groups, the flexible endoscope had several advantages over the standard laparoscope. The scope provided a flexible view of the operating field. The gallbladder dissection using the cutting device via the scope was easier and safer than that in standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The water-jet, suctioning, and self-cleaning lens functions of the scope served the surgery well.

We explore this opportunity in detail and focus on the polymer backbone as a decisive constituent of such formulations. Fourteen polyanions (polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonates) were analyzed for blood pro/anti coagulation effects, albumin binding and albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated macrophages. Ribavirin containing monomers were designed to accommodate the synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs with disulfide-exchange triggered drug release.

We adopted the technique of totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction in women who required right colon resection. METHODS Over a 2-year period, 14 women were scheduled for totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis and transvaginal colon removal. The indications for surgery included malignant (n=9) and benign (n=5) right-side colon pathology. RESULTS The procedure was accomplished laparoscopically in all patients. In 1 patient, the transvaginal removal was not possible because of a large tumor mass. The American Society of Anesthesiology was III in 13 and II in 1 patient. The mean body mass index was 31.65. Seventy-eight percent of patients had undergone abdominal surgery previously. The mean size of the lesion was 3.75 cm (range, 1.8 to 8.0 cm) and the mean number of lymph nodes was 18.7 (range, 8 to 37). All margins in the resected specimens were macroscopically and microscopically free of any tumor. One patient needed reoperation for intra-abdominal bleeding, whereas 3 patients developed postoperative ileus. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction is a safe and effective procedure that can be added to the armamentarium of surgeons performing laparoscopic colon surgery.

Neutralization of protein ligands, as for example cytokines or chemokines can lead to the validation of signalling pathways under physiological or pathophysiological conditions, and in certain cases, to the development of therapeutic molecules now used in autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation and cancer treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with pathologic N2 NSCLC who underwent complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 to 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base and stratified by use of PORT (≥ 45 Gy). A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n = 2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. RESULTS Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988).

Therefore, it is important to determine how to improve evidence-informed decision-making. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The secondary aim of the review was to describe factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies and the inter-relationship between these factors. METHODS An electronic search was developed to identify studies published between January 01, 2000, and February 02, 2016. This was supplemented by checking the reference list of included articles, systematic reviews, and hand-searching publication lists from prominent authors. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. RESULTS After duplicate removal, the search strategy identified 3830 titles. Following title and abstract screening, 96 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 19 studies (21 articles) met all inclusion criteria. Three studies were included in the narrative synthesis, finding policy briefs including expert opinion might affect intended actions, and intentions persisting to actions for public health policy in developing nations. Workshops, ongoing technical assistance, and distribution of instructional digital materials may improve knowledge and skills around evidence-informed decision-making in US public health departments. Tailored, targeted messages were more effective in increasing public health policies and programs in Canadian public health departments compared to messages and a knowledge broker. Sixteen studies (18 articles) were included in the thematic synthesis, leading to a conceptualisation of inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective research implementation strategies. A unidirectional, hierarchal flow was described from (1) establishing an imperative for practice change, (2) building trust between implementation stakeholders and (3) developing a shared vision, to (4) actioning change mechanisms. This was underpinned by the (5) employment of effective communication strategies and (6) provision of resources to support change. CONCLUSIONS Evidence is developing to support the use of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The design of future implementation strategies should be based on the inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies.

However, examination of cellular RNA using single-stranded probes revealed the presence of both ( + )sense and antisense RNA transcripts (45–70 copies per cell). In this BPV-based system the inhibitory activity appeared to be associated with a nonspecific, interferon (IFN)-mediated effect. In the second approach, an expression system was used which involved 293 cells, a chimeric human cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, and methotrexate- (Mtx)-mediated gene amplification. Cells were found to express up to 7500 copies of influenza virus-specific RNA per cell at a steady state level. In this system no RNA transcripts of the opposite orientation were found.

Methods We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0–7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia (≥ 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81–5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively.

This technique is expensive and associated with a long learning curve. To avoid these obstacles, we have developed an alternative approach using the Endorec(TM) trocar (Aspide, France), which combines the advantages of local transanal excision and single-port access. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients underwent transanal resection using Endorec trocar and standard laparoscopic instruments. A retrospective evaluation of the outcome of this technique was performed. RESULTS Fourteen patients were successfully operated. Rectal lesions included adenoma in ten patients, T1 adenocarcinoma in three and one T2 adenocarcinoma not amenable for abdominal surgery. The average distal margin from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 5-17 cm), and the mean diameter was 3.5 cm (range 1-5 cm). Negative margins were obtained in 13 patients (92,8 %). Median operating time was 60 min (range 20-100). The excisional area was sutured in nine patients. Median postoperative stay was 4 days (range 1-13). Postoperative complications (21 %) included postoperative fever in one patient and two patients were readmitted with rectal blood loss 6 and 15 days postoperatively and were treated with conservative measures.

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. METHODS: Cross-sectional ‘snapshot’ survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. FINDINGS: Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2•0% (23/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35•70 (IQR:32•42-37•57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3•46, 95%CI 1•38-8•67; p=0•008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. INTERPRETATION: The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.

METHODS In a randomized parallel trial, 110 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were randomly assigned for laparoscopic staging surgery with (group A, 55) or without (group B, 55) the use of a uterine manipulator (RUMI), between June 2009 and June 2011. Two sets of peritoneal washings were obtained, 1 before and 1 after the insertion of the uterine manipulator. Primary end points were the rates of positive cytology and lymphovascular space invasion. RESULTS No difference was detected in patient characteristics between the groups. Mean operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative complications were similar between the groups. Group A had a similar incidence of lymphovascular space invasion compared with group B (12.7% vs 9.1%, respectively; P = 0.761). Four patients (7.3%) in group A had positive peritoneal cytology in the initial washing. One of these patients was classified as stage IIIA. One patient in group B was positive in the second washing.

We hypothesized that patients with primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation would have higher RAGE levels in plasma than patients without PGD. OBJECTIVES To test the association of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels with PGD in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. METHODS We measured plasma levels of sRAGE at 6 and 24 hours after allograft reperfusion in 317 lung transplant recipients at seven centers. The primary outcome was grade 3 PGD (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) < 200 with alveolar infiltrates) within the first 72 hours after transplantation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients who developed PGD had higher levels of sRAGE than patients without PGD at both 6 hours (median 9.3 ng/ml vs. 7.5 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.028) and at 24 hours post-transplantation (median 4.3 ng/ml vs. 1.9 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the relationship between levels of sRAGE and PGD was attenuated by elevated right heart pressures and by the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sRAGE levels were higher in subjects with cardiopulmonary bypass at both 6 hours (P = 0.003) and 24 hours (P < 0.001). sRAGE levels at 6 hours were significantly associated with intraoperative red cell transfusion (Spearman's rho = 0.39, P = 0.002 in those with PGD), and in multivariable linear regression analyses this association was independent of confounding variables (P = 0.02).

We studied the impact of patient, disease, and treatment characteristics on clearance and immunogenicity of IFX in a real-world patient-with-IBD cohort. METHODS Serum concentrations of IFX and antibodies to IFX (ATIs) were measured in patients with IBD at a single center using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoassay. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were retrospectively collected along with laboratory values. Pharmacokinetics and ATI titer were analyzed simultaneously by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS Nine hundred ninety-seven IFX concentrations and 756 ATI measurements from 332 patients with IBD (253 Crohn's disease and 79 ulcerative colitis) were included. Mean (SD) IFX dose was 5.47 ± 1.33 mg/kg. ATIs were detected in 75/332 (23%) patients; insufficient exposure below an IFX trough level of 3 μg/mL was the most predictive factor of developing ATI and resulted in a 4-fold increased risk of ATI development. ATI titer was a better predictor of IFX clearance than ATI as a dichotomous parameter. ATI titers >30 AU/mL were consistently associated with undetectable IFX concentrations. IFX clearance was affected by body weight (40-149 kg) ranging from 0.27 to 0.53 L/d, serum albumin (2-5.4 g/dL) from 0.93 to 0.24 L/d, and titers of ATIs (0-53,000 AU/mL) from 0.36 L/d to 15.93 L/d (P < 0.001).

Almost 25 years later, Richard Pattle, John Clements and Chris Macklin, each working on the effects of nerve gases on the lungs, contributed to the understanding of the physiology of pulmonary surfactant. About 5 years later Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead published convincing evidence that preterm neonates dying of hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome, RDS) had a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The first trials of nebulized synthetic (protein-free) surfactant to prevent RDS were published soon after Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (son of President John F Kennedy) died of this disorder after treatment in Boston. These trials were unsuccessful; however, Goran Enhorning and Bengt Robertson in the early 1970s demonstrated that natural surfactants (containing proteins) were effective in an immature rabbit model of RDS. Soon after this Forrest Adams showed that a natural surfactant was also effective in an immature lamb model. Working with him was Tetsuro Fujiwara who 2 years later, after returning to Japan, published the seminal article reporting the responses of 10 preterm infants with RDS to a bolus of modified bovine surfactant. During the 1980s there were numerous randomized controlled trials of many different natural and synthetic surfactants, demonstrating reductions in pulmonary air leaks and neonatal mortality. Subsequently natural surfactants were shown to be superior to the protein-free synthetic products. Recently there have been a number of randomized trials comparing different natural surfactant preparations. Commercially available bovine surfactants may have similar efficacy but there is some evidence that a porcine surfactant used to treat RDS with an initial dose of 200 mg per kg is more effective than a bovine surfactant used in an initial dose of 100 mg per kg. Bovine and porcine surfactants have not been compared in trials of prophylaxis. Very recently a new synthetic surfactant with a surfactant protein mimic has been compared with other commercially available natural and synthetic surfactants in two trials. The new surfactant may be superior to one of the older protein-free synthetic surfactants but there is no evidence of its superiority over established natural products and it is currently not approved for clinical use. A number of other new synthetic surfactants have been tested in animal models or in treatment of adults with ARDS, but so far there have been no reports of treatment of neonatal RDS. Natural surfactants work best if given by a rapid bolus into the lungs but less invasive methods such as a laryngeal mask, pharyngeal deposition or rapid extubation to CPAP have showed promise. Unfortunately, delivery of surfactant by nebulization has so far been ineffective. Surfactant treatment has been tried in a number of other neonatal respiratory disorders but only infants with meconium aspiration seem to benefit although larger and more frequent doses are probably needed to demonstrate improved lung function.

This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the near-neighbor organisms as threats.

Using this system, we deleted the ORF3 gene entirely from the viral genome and showed that the ORF3 protein is not essential for replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, we inserted heterologous genes (i.e. the GFP and Renilla luciferase genes) at two positions in the viral genome, either as an extra expression cassette or as a replacement for the ORF3 gene. We demonstrated the expression of both GFP and Renilla luciferase as well as the application of these viruses by establishing a convenient and rapid virus neutralization assay.

MATERIAL AND METHODS From October 2010 to November 2010, 10 consecutive, left TPLDNs were performed. The SILS Port was inserted through the umbilicus and was used for 5-mm laparoscope and laparoscopic instruments. A 12-mm trocar, for another working channel, was inserted along the midclavicular line at the umbilicus level. No articulating or bent laparoscopic instruments were needed. Two retraction sutures were used; a 3-0 Prolene suture was passed through the pericolic fat and then brought out of the abdominal wall and secured to the skin. Another suture was passed around the lower pole fat of the kidney, which was then fixed on the abdominal wall with a clamp. RESULTS TPLDN was performed successfully in all patients, with no conversions to a conventional laparoscopic procedure or additional trocar insertion needed. The mean operative time was 152 ± 16.3 minutes, and the mean warm ischemia time was 2.9 ± 0.9. The average estimated blood loss was 77.3 ± 70 mL, and the postoperative hospital stay was 3.6 ± 0.6 days. No perioperative or postoperative complications were observed. Cosmesis was excellent, with a mean incision length of 5.6 ± 0.4 cm. All allografts functioned after transplantation.

However, controversy has developed regarding the length of the nail itself. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in reoperation rate, as well as operating time, length of hospital stay and 1-year mortality between short and long intramedullary nails in IFF-type AO 31-A1 and AO 31-A2. DATA SOURCES A search was conducted using PUBMED, Embase and Cochrane Central (January 1, 2000-August 1, 2018). Articles written in English, German or Scandinavian language were included. STUDY SELECTION Studies with patients > 18 years having an IFF comparing short nail with long nail and a least one of the clinical outcomes on interest (reoperation rate, operating time, length of hospital stay, 1-year mortality) were included.

In this population, influenza virus can replicate for prolonged periods, despite neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, leading to resistance and treatment failure. Baloxavir targets the influenza polymerase and may be an effective treatment option in these patients. METHODS We used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. RESULTS Two patients were infected with influenza A/H1pdm09 carrying a neuraminidase variant (H275Y) linked to oseltamivir resistance. Both these two patients were successfully treated with baloxavir.

However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 µg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 µg/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells.

NFV has also been shown to have in vitro inhibitory activity against human herpesviruses (HHVs). Given the apparent absence of an aspartyl protease encoded by HHVs, we investigated the mechanism of action of NFV herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in cultured cells. Selection of HSV-1 resistance to NFV was not achieved despite multiple passages under drug pressure. NFV did not significantly affect the level of expression of late HSV-1 gene products. Normal numbers of viral particles appeared to be produced in NFV-treated cells by electron microscopy but remain within the cytoplasm more often than controls. NFV did not inhibit the activity of the HSV-1 serine protease nor could its antiviral activity be attributed to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. NFV was found to decrease glycosylation of viral glycoproteins B and C and resulted in aberrant subcellular localization, consistent with induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response by NFV.

However, there has been little documentation regarding how the largest and oldest society dedicated to hand surgery has evolved over time. Further, an understanding of the history of the ASSH and the specialty of hand surgery should be emphasized in resident and fellow education. The authors aim to provide a historical overview of the ASSH through the speeches of ASSH past presidents which sheds light on future directions and long-term goals. Presidential addresses from 1961 to 2018 (courtesy of ASSH Chase Library historical archives) were reviewed. The overall percentage of ASSH presidents by specialty was 67% orthopaedic, 25% plastic surgery, and 8% general surgery. The most common speech theme overall was “how to be a good hand surgeon” (31%). The most common speech themes were as follows by decade: 1960’s, “history and the current state of ASSH”; 1970’s and 80’s “assessments of how to be a good surgeon” and “goals for ASSH”; 1990’s, “healthcare and governmental regulation”; 2000’s, “how to be a better hand surgeon”; 2010’s “goals for ASSH”. In earlier years, there was more of a focus on education and technical skill development in the ASSH. Work-life balance, introduced in the 1990s, has become more of a focus in the past 20 years. Revisiting the history of the ASSH and its goals allows us to reflect on the progress made while recognizing what is important as we look into the future.

Anesthesia techniques that minimize anesthetic requirements and their effects may be beneficial. Esmolol, a short acting hyperselective β-adrenergic blocker is effective in blunting adrenergic response to several perioperative stimuli and so it might interfere in the effect of the anesthetic drugs on the brain. This study was designed to investigate the effect of esmolol on the consumption of propofol and sevoflurane in patients undergoing craniotomy. METHOD Forty-two patients that underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping or tumour dissection were randomly divided in two groups (four subgroups). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and a single dose of cis-atracurium, followed by continuous infusion of remifentanil and either propofol or sevoflurane. Patients in the esmolol group received 500 mcg/kg of esmolol bolus 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by additional 200 mcg/kg/min of esmolol. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia was also performed using the Bispectral Index-BIS and cardiac output. The inspired concentration of sevoflurane and the infusion rate of propofol were adjusted in order to maintain a BIS value between 40-50. Intraoperative emergence was detected by the elevation of BIS value, HR or MAP. RESULTS The initial and the intraoperative doses of propofol and sevoflurane were 18-50 mcg/kg/min and 0.2-0.5 MAC respectively in the esmolol group, whereas in the control group they where 100-150 mcg/kg/ and 0.9-2.0 MAC respectively (p = 0.000 for both groups). All procedures were anesthesiologically uneventful with no episodes of intraoperative emerge. CONCLUSIONS Esmolol is effective not only in attenuating intraoperative hemodynamic changes related to sympathetic overdrive but also in minimizing significant propofol and sevoflurane requirements without compromising the hemodynamic status.

In this study, we evaluated whether pretreatment with SP600125 was able to prevent Orthopoxviruses Vaccinia virus (VACV), Cowpox virus (CPXV) and modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication. We found that incubation with SP600125 not only blocked virus-stimulated JNK phosphorylation, but also, significantly reduced virus production. We observed 1–3 log decline in viral yield depending on the cell line infected (A31, BSC-40 or BHK-21). The reduction in viral yield correlated with a dramatic impact on virus morphogenesis progress, intracellular mature viruses (IMV) were barely detected. Despite the fact that SP600125 can act as an efficient anti-orthopoxviral compound, we also provide evidence that this antiviral effect is not specifically exerted through JNK1/2 inhibition. This conclusion is supported by the fact that viral titers measured after infections of JNK1/2 knockout cells were not altered as compared to those of wild-type cells. In contrast, a decline in viral titers was verified when the infection of KO cells was carried out in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor.

IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5′ end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and ribosome recruitment. The presence of IFIT1 imposes a requirement on viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm to maintain mechanisms to avoid its restrictive effects. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 and IFIT3 interact via a YxxxL motif present in the C-terminus of each protein. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that also associates with IFIT1.

112846,lfq1znzm,,WHO,Low dose of hydroxychloroquine reduces fatality of critically ill patients with COVID-19,,,,unk,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality. The most urgent need is to find effective treatments. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020. All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments. Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm.

123667,1tb38v4k,,WHO,Understanding the age divide in COVID-19: why are children overwhelmingly spared?,,,,unk,"The rapid emergence and subsequent global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) has resulted in over 4 million cases worldwide. The disease has a marked predilection for adults, and children are relatively spared. Understanding the age-based differences in pathophysiological pathways and processes relevant to the onset and progression of disease both in the clinical course and in experimental disease models may hold the key to the identification of therapeutic targets. The differences in the clinical course are highlighted by the lack of progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond mild symptoms in a majority of children, whereas in adults the disease progresses to acute lung injury and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like phenotype with high mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to decreased lung injury in children may involve the decreased expression of the mediators necessary for viral entry into the respiratory epithelium and differences in the immune system responses in children. Specifically, decreased expression of proteins, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the airway epithelium in children may prevent viral entry. The immune system differences may include a relative preponderance of CD4+ T cells, decreased neutrophil infiltration, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased production of immunomodulatory cytokines in children compared with adults. Notably, the developing lung in children may have a greater capacity to recover and repair after viral infection. Understanding the relative contributions of the above processes to the protective phenotype in the developing lung can guide the trial of the appropriate therapies in adults.",2020,"Lingappan, K; Karmouty-Quintana, H; Davies, J; Akkanti, B; Harting, M T",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,,#506052,,,,,219315866.0,en,rapid emergence subsequent global dissemination sars-cov-2 disease covid-19 result 4 million case worldwide disease mark predilection adult child relatively spare understanding age-based difference pathophysiological pathway process relevant onset progression disease clinical course experimental disease model hold key identification therapeutic target difference clinical course highlight lack progression sars-cov-2 infection mild symptom majority child adult disease progress acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards)-like phenotype high mortality pathophysiological mechanism lead decrease lung injury child involve decrease expression mediator necessary viral entry respiratory epithelium difference immune system response child specifically decrease expression protein include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 airway epithelium child prevent viral entry immune system difference include relative preponderance cd4 t cell decrease neutrophil infiltration decrease production proinflammatory cytokine increase production immunomodulatory cytokine child compare adult notably develope lung child great capacity recover repair viral infection understanding relative contribution process protective phenotype develope lung guide trial appropriate therapy adult,153

A negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on access to care for children with cancer is likely but has not been evaluated. METHODS A 34-item survey focusing on barriers to pediatric oncology management during the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed to heads of pediatric oncology units within the Pediatric Oncology East and Mediterranean (POEM) collaborative group, from the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia. Responses were collected on April 11 through 22, 2020. Corresponding rates of proven COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization database. RESULTS In total, 34 centers from 19 countries participated. Almost all centers applied guidelines to optimize resource utilization and safety, including delaying off-treatment visits, rotating and reducing staff, and implementing social distancing, hand hygiene measures, and personal protective equipment use. Essential treatments, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, were delayed in 29% to 44% of centers, and 24% of centers restricted acceptance of new patients. Clinical care delivery was reported as negatively affected in 28% of centers. Greater than 70% of centers reported shortages in blood products, and 47% to 62% reported interruptions in surgery and radiation as well as medication shortages. However, bed availability was affected in <30% of centers, reflecting the low rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the corresponding countries at the time of the survey.

In the setting of intraprocedural or periprocedural embolism, thrombolytics present a potentially useful therapeutic strategy. A series of patients in whom eptifibatide (a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor) was used in the treatment of iatrogenic thromboembolic events occurring during elective neuroendovascular procedures is described. METHODS Consecutive cases between May 2009 and July 2011 in which eptifibatide was administered were identified and individually reviewed for inclusion in this study (n=12). All study patients received a uniform, weight based bolus dose of 180 μg/kg of eptifibatide administered either intra-arterially through the guide catheter or intravenously. Eptifibatide infusion (2 μg/kg/min) for 24 h after bolus dose administration was continued at the discretion of the surgeon. Procedural details are described and illustrative cases presented. RESULTS Three major categories of thromboembolic events were isolated in the course of review of study cases: acute focal neurological decline and no radiographic findings of flow limitation (eight patients), radiographic findings with or without symptoms (two patients) and persistent particulate debris during flow reversal as part of a carotid revascularization procedure (two patients). Following eptifibatide administration, no patient experienced hemorrhagic complications, and neurologic improvement to baseline level was noted in 10 of 12 patients.

To further quantify on-body path loss, measurements for five different on-body scenarios are presented as well. To compensate for the effect of often large path losses, two mitigation strategies to (dynamically) improve on-body links are introduced and experimentally verified: beam steering using a phased array, and usage of on-body RF repeaters.

We address this important problem from a computational and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period, based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical, age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR, which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around 0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future.",2020-06-23,"Stochictoiu, Radu D.; Rebedea, Traian; Popescu, Ionel; Leordeanu, Marius",,,,2006.1292600000002,document_parses/pdf_json/b07703dc4963e38d5575961a87289ebbea8e0f3d.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12926v1.pdf,219980716.0,en,analysing understand transmission evolution covid-19 pandemic mandatory able design social medical policy foresee outcome deal subsequent socio-economic effect address important problem computational machine learn perspective specifically want statistically estimate relevant parameter new coronavirus covid-19 reproduction numb fatality rate length infectiousness period base romanian patient good able predict future outcome endeavor important good know factor vary globe dependent cause include social medical age genetic factor use recently publish improve version seir classic establish model infectious disease want infer parameter model govern evolution pandemic romania base reliable true measurement numb death model parameter estimate able predict relevant measure numb expose infectious people end propose self-supervised approach train deep convolutional network guess correct set modified-seir model parameter observe numb daily fatality refine solution stochastic coordinate descent approach compare deep learn optimization scheme classic grid search approach great improvement computational time prediction accuracy find optimistic result case fatality rate romania 0.3 demonstrate model able correctly predict numb daily fatality week future,157

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this modality in a meta-analysis of the published literature. METHODS A comprehensive review protocol screened all reports in the literature. Strict selection criteria were applied to ensure consistency among the selected studies: human subjects, complete response data with time interval, resin microspheres, more than 5 patients, not a duplicate cohort, English language, and separate and complete data for resin-based (90)Y treatment of mNET if the study included multiple tumor and microsphere types. Selected studies were critically appraised on 50 study criteria, in accordance with the research reporting standards for radioembolization. Response data (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) were extracted and analyzed using both fixed and random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS One hundred fifty-six studies were screened; 12 were selected, totaling 435 procedures for response assessment. Funnel plots showed no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.841). Critical appraisal revealed a median of 75% of desired criteria included in selected studies. Very high between-study heterogeneity ruled out a fixed-effects model. The random-effects weighted average objective response rate (complete and partial responses, CR and PR, respectively) was 50% (95% confidence interval, 38%-62%), and weighted average disease control rate (CR, PR, and stable disease) was 86% (95% confidence interval, 78%-92%).

Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification.

A lot of malicious domain detection methods have received significant success in the past decades. However, existing detection methods usually use classification-based and association-based representations, which are not capable of dealing with the imbalanced problem between malicious and benign domains. To solve the problem, we propose a novel domain detection system named KSDom. KSDom designs a data collector to collect a large number of DNS traffic data and rich external DNS-related data, then employs K-means and SMOTE method to handle the imbalanced data.

Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01). Race, age and socioeconomic status were not identified as independent predictors.

More than 15% of adolescents have a body mass index (BMI) higher than the 95th percentile. The use of surgical strategies in adolescent patients is still controversial due to the impact on the continuing maturing process. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is considered a minimal invasive procedure that does not alter the physiological behavior of the bowel and has already shown promising results in short-term studies. METHODS Between 1998 and 2004, 50 adolescent patients above the 99.5th age- and gender-adjusted growing percentile were treated with LAGB. The surgical procedure was performed at three highly experienced centers for bariatric surgery. Mean age was 17.1 ± 2.2 years (range = 9-19 years) at the time of surgery. Follow-up investigations were performed in the outpatient clinic of the treating hospitals. Psychological changes were analyzed using the BAROS questionnaire. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased from 45.2 ± 7.6 kg/m(2) at the time of surgery to 38.3 ± 6.2 kg/m(2) 1 year after surgery, 31.5 ± 6.6 kg/m(2) after 3 years, and 27.3 ± 5.3 kg/m(2) after 5 years. Mean excessive weight loss was 49.7 ± 29.2, 76.8 ± 27.5, and 92.6 ± 24.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Quality of life showed a further significant improvement between 3 and 5 years after surgery (BAROS: 5.5 ± 1.9 increased to 6.3 ± 2.2, p = 0.01). All preoperative comorbidities resolved in patients with a functional band after 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION LAGB shows promising results in the long-term follow-up with continuous weight loss in patients with a functional band. Nevertheless, most of the weight loss is within the first 3 years after surgery. Thereafter, further weight reduction is about 10% over the following 2 years.

METHODS: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid‐19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. RESULTS: The majority of Covid‐19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre‐DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty‐four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non‐diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid‐19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, PreDM and obesity. Covid‐19 is asociated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid‐19 suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism.

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals’ perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals’ threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals’ motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals’ perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.",2020-05-06,"Farooq, Ali; Laato, Samuli; Islam, A K M Najmul",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205033.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/19128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330115/,216129786.0,en,background coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic government issue movement restriction place area quarantine combat spread disease addition individual encourage adopt personal health measure social isolation information regard disease recommend avoidance measure distribute variety channel include social medium news website email previous research suggest vast available information confuse potentially result overconcern information overload study investigate impact online information individual-level intention voluntarily self-isolate pandemic protection-motivation theory framework propose model outline effect cyberchondria information overload individual ’ perception motivation methods test propose model collect datum online survey n=225 analyze use partial little square-structural equation model effect social medium live situation test multigroup analysis results cyberchondria information overload significant impact individual ’ threat cope perception self-isolation intention appraisal construct perceive severity p=.002 self-efficacy p=.003 positively impact self-isolation intention response cost p<.001 affect intention negative cyberchondria p=.003 information overload p=.003 indirectly affect self-isolation intention aforementioned perception social medium information source increase cyberchondria information overload difference perception find people live live family conclusions covid-19 frequent use social medium contribute information overload overconcern individual boost individual ’ motivation adopt preventive measure self-isolation action focus lower individual ’ perceive response cost addition inform severity situation,186

At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates.

The purpose of this study was to assess the status of endovascular treatment of distal ACA aneurysms by comparing our results with recent endovascular and microsurgical series of distal ACA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 22 consecutive patients (14 women; mean age, 58.4 years) with distal ACA aneurysms underwent coil placement at Barrow Neurological Institute. Clinical presentations, radiographic findings, endovascular management, and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 22 patients, 13 (59%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six patients were HH grade I or II, 1 was grade III, 5 were grade IV, and 1 was grade V. Frontal lobe hematomas occurred in 5 patients with ruptured aneurysms. The mean aneurysm size was 7.5 mm (range, 2.8-25 mm); 55% were smaller than 7 mm. Twelve aneurysms (55%) arose from the origin of the callosomarginal artery (55%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 50% of the cases and near-complete occlusion in 45%. The few periprocedural complications included 1 retroperitoneal hematoma and 1 intraoperative rupture. Four patients had thromboembolic events adequately treated intraprocedurally with abciximab. No deaths occurred in the patients treated. CONCLUSIONS The characteristics of the patients and aneurysms treated in our series were comparable to previous reports of endovascular treatment of ACA aneurysms with respect to rupture status. Periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates in our series fared well compared with previous reports, as did our combined rate of complete or near-complete occlusions.

PRDC is caused by a combination of viral and bacterial agents, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Myh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Pasteurella multocida and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2). To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p.

Despite this vogue, the security vulnerabilities of MLPUs remain mostly unknown. Aim: To address this concern, we conduct a study to understand the test time security vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art MLPU systems, aiming at providing guidelines for the future development of these systems. Method: In this paper, we propose an evasion attack framework against MLPU systems. To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial phishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline performance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU systems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to previous works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with an average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and less popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively; (ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL variant that is available for registration with a median cost of only $11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google SafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that Adversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not significantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the success rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv) Further, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU systems. Our findings lead to promising directions for future research.

Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.",2011-12-31,,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,,,,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012375158400002X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012375158400002X,214755499.0,en,publisher summary chapter describe virus replication development vitro cell culture technique virus propagate natural host bacterial virus relatively simple process permit early development laboratory research method possible plant animal virus animal virus sample affect animal collect use infect animal initially species consistent result obtain attempt usually determine species susceptible chapter explain advent vitro animal cell culture bring research study line involve bacterial virus reduce risk associate adventitious virus animal inoculation system enhance diagnostic test vitro cell culture system use artificial medium develope maintain cell viability outside source species organ culture explant culture primary cell culture cell line organ culture maintain three-dimensional structure tissue use short-term experiment fundamental characteristic separate virus replicate entity manner new virus particle synthesize viruses use binary fission virus particle assemble de novo structural component synthesize somewhat independent synchronize event critical ﻿1 step virus replication cycle bind virus particle host cell bind process involve series interaction define host range virus tissue/organ specificity,155

METHODS: The initial histopathological finding of Besnoitia cysts in skin lumps that were presumed to be sarcoids in 2013 triggered our cognisance of this parasite and resulted in identification of a total of 20 cases. Histopathological examination of surgical biopsy samples collected from 8 live donkeys and tissue specimens from 12 deceased donkeys at post-mortem examination revealed the presence of Besnoitia cysts in all 20 donkeys. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and immunoblotting analysis showed the presence of anti-Besnoitia antibodies in archived serum samples from 4 deceased donkeys. Additionally, infection was evidenced in one live donkey based on IFAT and immunoblot analysis of tissue fluid of a dermal mass containing Besnoitia cysts, and real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and microsatellite genotyping of DNA isolated from the tissue of the same dermal mass confirmed the infection specifically as B. bennetti. RESULTS: Both serological and microsatellite analyses confirmed the aetiology to be B. bennetti. Our findings suggested that in cases of skin masses such as sarcoids, the suspicion of B. bennetti infection should be borne in mind even when clinical and histopathology examination results are negative in order to avoid misdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case series documents, to our knowledge, the first report of B. bennetti infection in donkeys in the UK, indicating that donkey besnoitiosis has become noteworthy in the UK.

Although glycyrrhizin which exhibited in vivo efficacy against HSV-1 replication showed moderate in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity, its sapogenol, glycyrrhetic acid, showed 10 times greater action than glycyrrhizin. Therefore, the in vivo anti-HSV-1 activity of glycyrrhizin administered orally could be reasonably attributed to glycyrrhetic acid generated by hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria. Since the activity of soyasapogenol A was less than 1/20 of that of soyasapogenol B, the hydroxylation at C-21 seemed to reduce anti-HSV-1 activity. Since kudzusapogenol A, abrisapogenols B and C lacked the activity, the C-29 hydroxy group would eliminate anti-HSV-1 activity.

Herein, we summarize the available literature and fill-in the gaps in this regard. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""HLH"", ""HScore"", ""coagulopathy"", ""D-dimer"", ""cytokine storm"", ""children"" and ""pediatrics"" with interposition of Boolean operator ""AND"". RESULTS Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 µg/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSION HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.",2020-06-24,"Bhattacharjee, Sukrita; Banerjee, Mainak; Pal, Rimesh",Indian pediatrics,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32583809/,220059378.0,en,context preliminary datum coexistence secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome hlh disseminate intravascular coagulation dic critically ill child novel coronavirus disease covid-19 emerge summarize available literature fill-in gap regard evidence acquisition perform literature search article pubmed embase google scholar database till 12 2020 follow keyword covid-19 sars-cov-2 hlh hscore coagulopathy d-dimer cytokine storm child pediatrics interposition boolean operator results children present moderate-severe covid-19 kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous hlh hscore validate tool diagnose hlh suggest screen severe covid-19 patient cytokine storm hscore face certain limitation scenario pragmatic use high d-dimer 3 µg/ml instead low fibrinogen facilitate early detection cytokine storm covid-19 associate coagulopathy resemble hypercoagulable form dic bleed rarely report international society thrombosis haemostasis isth interim guidance recommend low molecular weight heparin hospitalize patient datum lack population 14 year age presence life-threatening thromboembolic event symptomatic acro-ischemia unfractionated heparin ufh use caution conclusion hscore use complement clinical decision initiate immunosuppression children moderate-to-severe covid-19 especially document thrombocytopenia chilblain regularly monitor coagulopathy,161

This is particularly so for professionals (doctors and nurses). However, the health service also depends on non-professionals, such as porters, cooks and cleaners. The duty to work is currently under scrutiny because of the ongoing challenge of responding to pandemic influenza, where an effective response depends on most uninfected HCWs continuing to work, despite personal risk. This paper reports findings of a survey of HCWs (n = 1032) conducted across three National Health Service trusts in the West Midlands, UK, to establish whether HCWs' likelihood of working during a pandemic is associated with views about the duty to work. The sense that HCWs felt that they had a duty to work despite personal risk emerged strongly regardless of professional status. Besides a strong sense that everyone should pull together, all kinds of HCWs recognised a duty to work even in difficult circumstances, which correlated strongly with their stated likelihood of working. This suggests that HCWs' decisions about whether or not they are prepared to work during a pandemic are closely linked to their sense of duty. However, respondents' sense of the duty to work may conflict with their sense of duty to family, as well as other factors such as a perceived lack of reciprocity from their employers.

We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. METHODS Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1-6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. RESULTS A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks.

96530,mh0v8lau,,WHO,Long-term potentiation prevents ketamine-induced aberrant neurophysiological dynamics in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway in vivo,,,,unk,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonists such as ketamine (KET) produce psychotic-like behavior in both humans and animal models. NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related to schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that prior long-term potentiation (LTP) occluded the increase of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway induced by MK-801, a non-competitive NMDAr antagonist. However, it is not clear whether LTP could also modulate aberrant oscillations and short-term plasticity disruptions induced by NMDAr antagonists. Thus, we tested whether LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.",2020,"Lopes-Aguiar, Cleiton; Ruggiero, Rafael N; Rossignoli, Matheus T; Esteves, Ingrid de Miranda; Peixoto-Santos, José Eduardo; Romcy-Pereira, Rodrigo N; Leite, João P",Sci Rep,,#32346044,,,,,202852180.0,en,n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor nmdar antagonist ketamine ket produce psychotic-like behavior human animal model nmdar hypofunction affect normal oscillatory dynamic synaptic plasticity key brain region relate schizophrenia particularly hippocampus prefrontal cortex prior long-term potentiation ltp occlude increase synaptic efficacy hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway induce mk-801 non-competitive nmdar antagonist clear ltp modulate aberrant oscillation short-term plasticity disruption induce nmdar antagonist test ltp mitigate electrophysiological change promote ket record hpc-pfc local field potential evoke response urethane anesthetize rat ket administration precede ltp induction result ket promote aberrant delta-high-gamma cross-frequency couple pfc enhancement hpc-pfc evoke response ltp induction prior ket attenuate change synaptic efficiency prevent increase cortical gamma amplitude comodulation finding consistent evidence increase efficiency glutamatergic receptor attenuate cognitive impairment animal model psychosis high-frequency stimulation hpc useful tool understand prevent nmdar hypofunction effect synaptic plasticity oscillatory coordination cortico-limbic circuit,133

Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",2009-05-15,"Scull, Margaret A.; Gillim-Ross, Laura; Santos, Celia; Roberts, Kim L.; Bordonali, Elena; Subbarao, Kanta; Barclay, Wendy S.; Pickles, Raymond J.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0162b627476379a84d5a92480a881efdd3063f66.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2673688.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673688/,,en,transmission avian influenza virus bird human rare event avian influenza virus infect ciliated epithelium human airway vitro ex vivo vitro model human ciliated airway epithelium hae demonstrate human avian influenza virus efficiently infect temperature human distal airway 37 ° c avian human influenza virus restrict infection cool temperature human proximal airway 32 ° c datum support hypothesis avian influenza virus ordinarily adapt temperature avian enteric tract 40 ° c rarely infect human difference host airway regional temperature previously critical residue position 627 avian influenza virus polymerase subunit pb2 identify confer temperature-dependency mammalian cell use reverse genetic avianization residue 627 attenuate human virus doe account different infection 32 ° c 37 ° c determine mechanism temperature restriction avian influenza virus hae 32 ° c generate recombinant human influenza virus a/victoria/3/75 h3n2 a/pr/8/34 h1n1 genetic background contain avian avian-like glycoprotein virus a/victoria/3/75 l226q s228 g mutation hemagglutinin ha neuraminidase na a/chick/italy/1347/99 a/pr/8/34 contain h7 n1 a/chick/italy/1347/99 exhibit temperature restriction approach wholly avian influenza virus datum suggest influenza virus bear avian avian-like surface glycoprotein reduce capacity establish productive infection temperature human proximal airway temperature restriction limit zoonotic transmission avian influenza virus suggest adaptation avian influenza virus efficient infection 32 ° c represent critical evolutionary step enable human-to-human transmission,205

On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak, a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. RESULTS: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain–Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options. Physicians should be cautious not to overlook other neurological diagnoses that can mimic COVID-19 during the pandemic.

We investigated the presence of E. coli in tissue samples (liver, lung and intestines) collected from 50 fruit bats of five different species (Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Rousettus aegyptiacus) of two different areas in the Republic of Congo between 2009 and 2010. To assess E. coli pathotypes and phylogenetic relationships, we determined the presence of 59 virulence associated genes and multilocus sequence types (STs). Isolates were further tested for their susceptibility to several antimicrobial substances by agar disk diffusion test and for the presence of an Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase phenotype. E. coli was detected in 60% of the bats analysed. The diversity of E. coli strains was very high, with 37 different STs within 40 isolates. Occasionally, we detected sequence types (e.g. ST69, ST127, and ST131) and pathotypes (e.g. ExPEC, EPEC and atypical EPEC), which are known pathogens in human and/or animal infections. Although the majority of strains were assigned to phylogenetic group B2 (46.2%), which is linked with the ExPEC pathovar, occurrence of virulence-associated genes in these strains were unexpectedly low. Due to this, and as only few of the E. coli isolates showed intermediate resistance to certain antimicrobial substances, we assume a rather naïve E. coli population, lacking contact to humans or domestic animals.

The present studies investigated the role of the chemokine CXCL10 and its specific receptor, CXCR3, in the host response to pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Antibody-mediated neutralization of CXCL10 resulted in a significant increase in disease pathogenesis, including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus gene expression, and impaired viral clearance. When the pulmonary cytokine levels were examined, only type I IFN and IL-12p70 were significantly reduced. These latter observations were reflected in reduced dendritic cell (DC) numbers and DC maturation in the lungs of RSV-infected mice treated with anti-CXCL10. Neutralization of the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3, resulted in similar increases in pathogenic responses. When bone marrow-derived DC were incubated with CXCL10 and RSV, an up-regulation of type I IFN was observed.

We demonstrate here that anti-CD81 antibodies inhibit HCV infection at late times after virus internalization, suggesting a role for intracellular CD81 in HCV infection. Several tetraspanins have been reported to internalize via motifs in their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains; however, CD81 lacks such motifs, leading several laboratories to suggest a limited role for CD81 endocytosis in HCV entry. We demonstrate CD81 internalization via a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process, independent of its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a role for associated partner proteins in regulating CD81 trafficking. Live cell imaging demonstrates CD81 and claudin-1 coendocytosis and fusion with Rab5 expressing endosomes, supporting a role for this receptor complex in HCV internalization.

METHODS PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, The Global Health Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and PACTR were searched for published and unpublished trials in Africa without language restriction (up to April 2018). Trials reporting effect estimates on healthcare appointment attendance and medicine adherence were assessed for risk of bias and included in meta-analyses using random-effects models. Other outcomes were reported descriptively. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO, ID:CRD42018081062. RESULTS We included 38 one-way SMS trials conducted in Africa within a broad range of clinical conditions. Eighteen trials were included in the meta-analyses, and four were assessed as overall low risk of bias. One-way SMS improved appointment attendance, OR:2·03; 95% CI:1·40-2·95 (12 trials, 6448 participants), but not medicine adherence, RR:1·10; 95% CI:0·98-1·23 (nine trials, 4213 participants). Subgroup analyses showed that one-way SMS had the highest impact on childhood immunization attendance, OR:3·69; 95% CI:1·67-8·13 (three trials, 1943 participants). There was no clear evidence of one-way SMS improving facility delivery, knowledge level (reproductive/antenatal health, hypertension), diabetes- and hypertension management.

It is well established that social support has been related to the onset of PTSD after natural disasters. However, very little is known whether or not social support has had an influence on the recovery from the PTSD that was diagnosed after floods. This study, therefore, made a follow-up assessment of PTSD in flood victims 13–14 years after they were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD among them and identify the association between social support and their recovery from PTSD. METHODS: Victims who had experienced Dongting Lake flood in 1998 and had been diagnosed as having PTSD in 2000 were enrolled in this study. A follow-up survey was done between the years 2013 and 2014 to diagnose the victims again of PTSD using the DSM-IV criteria. Social support and its three dimensions were measured using the Chinese version of Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), including objective support, subjective support and support utilization. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and the recovery from PTSD after flood. RESULTS: Out of 321 subjects with prior PTSD, 51 (15.89 %) were diagnosed as still having PTSD. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the recovery from prior PTSD was significantly associated with social support (odds ratio (OR) =0.202, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.047–0.878), subjective support (OR = 0.236, 95 % CI: 0.080–0.694) and support utilization (OR = 0.245, 95 % CI: 0.071–0.844).

In addition to mechanical barriers and a variety of innate defense factors, mucosal immunoglobulins (Igs) provide protection by two complementary mechanisms: specific antibody activity and innate, Ig glycan-mediated binding, both of which serve to contain the mucosal microbiota in its physiological niche. Thus, the interaction of bacterial ligands with IgA glycans constitutes a discrete mechanism that is independent of antibody specificity and operates primarily in the intestinal tract. This mucosal site is by far the most heavily colonized with an enormously diverse bacterial population, as well as the most abundant production site for antibodies, predominantly of the IgA isotype, in the entire immune system.

Severe disseminated infections with high mortality rates may be seen in immunocompromised individuals. An accurate and cost-effective quantitative assay is essential not only for laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infections, but also for monitoring of response to antiviral treatment. The diagnostic performance of an in-house quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was compared to a commercial system. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy of an in-house adenovirus quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were evaluated against the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency testing samples. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of the quantitative results by the in-house assay showed the dynamic range from 2.60 to 9 log(10) (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log(10) (viral transport medium) copies/mL, with the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively. A dilution series demonstrated the limits of detection and lower limits of quantification for plasma were 2.06 log(10) and 2.60 log(10) copies/mL and those for viral transport medium were 2.31 log(10) and 2.94 log(10) copies/mL respectively. The precision of the in-house assay was highly reproducible among runs with coefficients of variance ranging from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for viral transport medium. A comparison of 52 matched samples showed an excellent correlation between the quantitative viral loads measured by the in-house assay and the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit (R(2) = 0.984), with an average bias of − 0.16 log(10) copies/mL.

Existing theories of virulence evolution based on a tradeoff between high transmission rates and long infectious periods imply that epidemic growth conditions will select for higher virulence, possibly leading to a transient peak in virulence near the beginning of an epidemic. This transient selection could lead to high virulence in emerging pathogens. Using a simple model of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging pathogens, along with rough estimates of parameters for pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus and myxomatosis, we estimated the potential magnitude and timing of such transient virulence peaks. Pathogens that are moderately evolvable, highly transmissible, and highly virulent at equilibrium could briefly double their virulence during an epidemic; thus, epidemic-phase selection could contribute significantly to the virulence of emerging pathogens. In order to further assess the potential significance of this mechanism, we bring together data from the literature for the shapes of tradeoff curves for several pathogens (myxomatosis, HIV, and a parasite of Daphnia) and the level of genetic variation for virulence for one (myxomatosis).

SETTING Tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Four hundred ten patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. DESIGN Prospective observational study. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Autoregulation was monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass by calculating a continuous, moving Pearson's correlation coefficient between mean arterial blood pressure and processed near-infrared spectroscopy signals to generate the variable cerebral oximetry index. When mean arterial blood pressure is below the lower limit of autoregulation, cerebral oximetry index approaches 1, because cerebral blood flow is pressure passive. An identifiable lower limit of autoregulation was ascertained in 348 patients. Based on the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage renal disease), acute kidney injury developed within 7 days of surgery in 121 (34.8%) of these patients. Although the average mean arterial blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not differ, the mean arterial blood pressure at the limit of autoregulation and the duration and degree to which mean arterial blood pressure was below the autoregulation threshold (mm Hg × min/hr of cardiopulmonary bypass) were both higher in patients with acute kidney injury than in those without acute kidney injury. Excursions of mean arterial blood pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation (relative risk 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.03; p < 0.0001) and diabetes (relative risk 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.50; p = 0.001) were independently associated with for acute kidney injury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In bovine liver tissue, 42 ex vivo microwave ablations (60 W; 180 s) were performed. During ablation, the temperature was measured continuously at 4 points of interest (POI), in a distance of 7.5 and 15 mm on each side of the microwave antenna, with a titanium surgical placed at one 7.5-mm POI. Ablation volumes containing large vessels (n = 10) were excluded. For every POI, the mean temperature of 32 ablations was calculated. The mean temperatures were compared between the 4 POI and statistically analyzed using the Student's t test. RESULTS The mean maximum temperatures at the side of the clip were 88.76 °C/ 195 s and 52.97 °C/ 195 s and at the side without clip 78.75 °C/ 195 s and 43.16 °C/ 195 s, respectively, at POI 7.5 mm and POI 15 mm. The maximum difference of mean temperatures for POI 7.5 mm was 12.91 °C at 84 s (p = 0.022) and for POI 15 mm 9.77 °C at 195 s (p = 0.009). No significant changes in size and shape of the ablation zone could be determined. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated significantly higher temperatures adjacent to surgical clips.

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.",2019-07-24,"Graepel, Kevin W.; Agostini, Maria L.; Lu, Xiaotao; Sexton, Nicole R.; Denison, Mark R.",Journal of Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e997f06260307d229b94ee2742e73e8e06061ddb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6798108.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341046/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/20/e00711-19.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00711-19,198495023.0,en,3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease coronavirus cov nonstructural protein 14 nsp14-exon mediate rna proofread genome replication exon catalytic residue arrange motif de ii e iii d alanine replacement motif residue aa-e-d nucleotide substitution murine hepatitis virus mhv severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov yield viable mutant impair replication fitness increase mutation rate attenuate virulence vivo despite impairment mhv- sars-cov exon motif aa mutant exon-aa revert motif diverse vitro vivo environment suggest profound fitness barrier prevent motif reversion test hypothesis engineer mhv-exon-aa 1 2 3 nucleotide mutation genetic pathway aa-to-de reversion engineer intermediate revertants viable increase replication competitive fitness compare mhv-exon-aa contrast low-passage-number passage 10 p10 mhv-exon-aa increase replication competitive fitness reversion exon-aa finally engineer reversion exon-aa exon-de presence exon-aa passage-adaptive mutation result significant fitness loss result demonstrate reversion possible little alternative adaptive pathway rapidly advantageous intermediate revertants alter genetic background render reversion detrimental fitness result provide evolutionary rationale lack exon-aa reversion illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interaction coevolution support future study aim stabilize attenuate cov exon-aa mutant importance coronaviruses encode exoribonuclease exon important viral replication fitness virulence coronavirus defective exon exon-aa revert diverse experimental condition study identify multiple impediment mhv-exon-aa reversion exon-aa reversion possible evolutionarily unfavorable instead compensatory mutation outside exon-aa motif accessible beneficial partial reversion coevolution replicase protein long-term passage partially compensate exon-aa motif render virus inhospitable revert exon. result reveal evolutionary basis genetic stability exon-inactivating mutation illuminate complex functional evolutionary relationship coronavirus replicase protein identify potential mechanism stabilization exon-aa coronavirus mutant,238

Parallel to other studies, we used the new device for selected patients who were no optimal candidates for established techniques like neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. We aimed to report the angiographic and clinical results of WEB implantations or combinations between WEB and coiling or intracranial stents. METHODS We reviewed the records of n = 23 interventions in 22 patients with unruptured wide-neck aneurysms (UIA) who were assigned for aneurysm treatment with the use of the WEB or adjunctive techniques. Interventional procedures and clinical and angiographic outcomes are reported for the periprocedural phase and in mid-term FU. RESULTS Of the included 22 patients, six patients needed additional coiling, intracranial stenting, or implantation of a flow diverter. WEB implantation was technically feasible in 22 out of the 23 interventions. Follow-up angiographic imaging proved total or subtotal occlusion of the aneurysm in 19 of 22 cases. Two minor recurrences remained stable during a period of 15 months. One patient with a partially thrombosed giant MCA aneurysm had a major recurrence and was retreated with a second WEB in combination with coiling.

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case–control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

However, the process is not flawless, and difficulties remain during cloning of influenza gene segments into reverse genetics vectors (pHW2000, pHH21, pCAGGS). Reverse genetics begins with making cDNA copies of influenza gene segments and cloning them into bi-directional (pHW2000) or uni-directional plasmids (pHH21, pCAGGS) followed by transfection of the recombinant plasmid(s) to HEK-293 T or any other suitable cells which are permissive to transfection. However, the presence of internal restriction sites in the gene segments of many field isolates of avian influenza viruses makes the cloning process difficult, if employing conventional methods. Further, the genetic instability of influenza gene-containing plasmids in bacteria (especially Polymerase Basic 2 and Polymerase Basic 1 genes; PB2 and PB1) also leads to erroneous incorporation of bacterial genomic sequences into the influenza gene of interest. METHODS: Herein, we report an easy and efficient ligation and restriction enzyme independent (LREI) cloning method for cloning influenza gene segments into pHW2000 vector. The method involves amplification of megaprimers followed by PCR amplification of megaprimers using a bait plasmid, DpnI digestion and transformation. RESULTS: Hard-to-clone genes: PB2 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2) and PB1 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2), A/chicken/Jiangxi/02.05YGYXG023-P/2015 (H5N6) and A/Chicken/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4–315/2014 (H9N2) were cloned into pHW2000 using our LREI method and recombinant viruses were subsequently rescued. CONCLUSION: The LREI cloning procedure represents an alternative strategy for cloning influenza gene segments which have internal restriction sites for the enzymes used in reverse genetics. Further, the problem of genetic instability in bacteria can be alleviated by growing recombinant bacterial cultures at a lower temperature. This technique can be applied to clone any influenza gene segment using universal primers, which would help in rapid generation of influenza viruses and facilitate influenza research and vaccine development.",2020-06-23,"Bhat, Sushant; Bialy, Dagmara; Sealy, Joshua E.; Sadeyen, Jean-Remy; Chang, Pengxiang; Iqbal, Munir",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6b670638b6a97ca410a8b70ab28f9ac11f710fc6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7309217.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309217/,,en,background reverse genetic use laboratory world enable creation tailor-made influenza virus desire genotype phenotype process flawless difficulty remain clone influenza gene segment reverse genetic vector phw2000 phh21 pcaggs reverse genetic begin cdna copy influenza gene segment clone bi-directional phw2000 uni-directional plasmid phh21 pcaggs follow transfection recombinant plasmid(s hek-293 t suitable cell permissive transfection presence internal restriction site gene segment field isolate avian influenza virus clone process difficult employ conventional method genetic instability influenza gene-containing plasmid bacterium especially polymerase basic 2 polymerase basic 1 gene pb2 pb1 lead erroneous incorporation bacterial genomic sequence influenza gene interest methods report easy efficient ligation restriction enzyme independent lrei clone method clone influenza gene segment phw2000 vector method involve amplification megaprimers follow pcr amplification megaprimers use bait plasmid dpni digestion transformation results hard-to-clone gene pb2 a/chicken/bangladesh/23527/2014 h9n2 pb1 a/chicken/bangladesh/23527/2014 h9n2 a/chicken/jiangxi/02.05ygyxg023-p/2015 h5n6 a/chicken/vietnam/h7f-14-bn4–315/2014 h9n2 clone phw2000 use lrei method recombinant virus subsequently rescue conclusion lrei clone procedure represent alternative strategy clone influenza gene segment internal restriction site enzyme use reverse genetic problem genetic instability bacterium alleviate grow recombinant bacterial culture low temperature technique apply clone influenza gene segment use universal primer help rapid generation influenza virus facilitate influenza research vaccine development,196

This has been related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as animal studies indicate that these medications increase levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has prompted clinicians to recommend discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of ACEIs or ARBs treatment on serum levels of ACE2 and other key enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75±6 years) stratified by ACEIs (N = 699) or ARBs (N = 753) treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The AGES-RS study population was stratified by ACEIs and ARBs medication use and compared for age, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)), hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as serum levels of renin, ACE and ACE2. RESULTS: While renin and ACE levels were significantly raised in serum of individuals on ACEIs or ARBs treatments, the ACE2 levels remained unaffected.

Objectives To determine whether an increase in severe EV-D68 respiratory infections was observed in our region. Study design Samples from patients with respiratory symptoms were screened for viral pathogens, including rhinovirus and enterovirus. Subsequently, samples positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus were routinely sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, an additional method was used to detect EV-D68 specifically. Results During the first three quarters of the year 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were analyzed; 39 (2%) of them tested positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. Eleven were children below the age of 18, of whom five children needed intensive care treatment. The remaining five samples were from adults, who all had an underlying disease; three were transplant patients (heart, lung and renal transplantation), the other two had an underlying lung condition (COPD, asthma). Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with the strains circulating currently in the USA, all belonging to the known EV-D68 genetic subtypes. Conclusions We observed an increase of EV-D68 infections in our population, both in children as well as in adult.

Results. Humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine. Histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets. SARS-CoV infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue, as seen previously in infected mice. No evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the ferrets. All of the ferrets cleared the virus by day 14, 1 week earlier if vaccinated. Conclusions.

Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures.

The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy—one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 “Spanish influenza” pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400–470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder.

Novel training models proposed in this work aim to address various aspects of interest in the artificial intelligence applications domain. Topics discussed include data imputation, semi-supervised labelling and synthetic instance simulation when using sparse training data. Innovative semi-supervised ensemble learning paradigms are proposed focusing on labelling threshold selection and stringency of classification confidence levels. A regression-correlation combination (RCC) data imputation method is also introduced for handling of partially complete training data. Results presented in this work show data imputation precision improvement over benchmark value replacement using proposed RCC on 70% of test cases. Proposed novel incremental transductive models such as ITSVM have provided interesting findings based on threshold constraints outperforming standard SVM application on 21% of test cases and can be applied with alternative environment-based epidemic disease domains.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational assessment was conducted in 6 university hospital otorhinolaryngology departments (Paris Centre, Nord, Est and Sorbonne) during the 1-month periods before (Month A) and after (Month B) lockdown on March 17, 2020. The main goal was to evaluate lockdown impact on oncologic surgical activity in the departments. Secondary goals were to report population characteristics, surgery conditions, postoperative course, progression of Covid status in patients and surgeons, and adverse events. RESULTS: 224 procedures were performed. There was 10.9% reduction in overall activity, without significant difference between departments. Squamous cell carcinoma and larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity and nasal cavity and sinus locations were predominant, at 79% and 75.8% of cases respectively, with no significant differences between months. T3/4 and N2/3 tumors were more frequent in Month B (P=.002 and .0004). There was no significant difference between months regarding surgical approach, type of reconstruction, postoperative course, tracheotomy and nasogastric feeding-tube time, intensive care stay or hospital stay.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the holding position, shapes, bend angles of the endotracheal tube (ET) and the stylet-assisted lifting of the epiglottis could improve the success rate of intubation. METHODS Thirty-two participants, 26 physicians, 2 residents, and 4 nurse practitioners, with 12.09 ± 5.38 years of work experience in the emergency department and more than 150 annual intubation events, were enrolled in this randomized, cross-over mannequin study. We investigated the effects of straight-to-cuff ET shapes with 35° and 50° bend angles, banana-shaped ET with longitudinal distances of 28 cm and 26 cm, two methods of holding the ET (either on the top or in the middle), and lifting or not the epiglottis, on the intubation duration, its success rate, and its subjective difficulty. The aim of the study is to provide optimized intubation strategies for difficult airway with C-L IIb or III grades, when the inlet of the trachea cannot be visualized. RESULTS The two groups that lifted the epiglottis using the stylets, in bend angles of 35° and 50°, had the shortest duration of intubation (23.75 ± 14.24 s and 20.72 ± 6.90 s, hazard ratios 1.54 and 1.85 with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] of 1.01-2.34 and 1.23-2.78, respectively) and a 100% success rate in intubations. In the survival analysis, lifting of the epiglottis was the only significant factor (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) associated with the success rate of intubation. CONCLUSIONS The use of the epiglottic lift as an adjunctive technique can facilitate the intubation and improve its success rate without increasing procedure difficulty, in C-L III airway, when only the epiglottis is seen.

Methylene blue-plasma (MBP) has been used for over 20 years, but its efficacy in this setting remains controversial. Patients and methods: this is a comparative analysis of the experience of two Centres, with different plasma products, to evaluate their efficacy in TTP. One centre used quarantine plasma (QP), and MBP the other. We performed a retrospective longitudinal study, analysing the clinical files of TTP patients of a 13-year data evaluation period. Duration of treatment and transfusion parameters, medical record, laboratory testing, concomitant medication, and survival rate, were assessed for every episode. Results During the study period, 12 (55.5 %) and 10 (45.5 %) new cases were treated with QP and MBP, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of TPE processes, days elapsed from diagnosis to TPE, and plasma volume transfused. The QP TPE episodes of treatment were significantly associated with an increased time to recovery compared with MBP episodes of treatment (p = 0.004). Conclusion MBP was as effective as QP in the treatment of TTP patients. Since recovery was more favourable when MBP was used, we consider MBP remains a suitable alternative to treat TTP patients.",2020-04-12,"Rodríguez, José L.

Due to absence of specific vaccine or therapy, non-pharmacological interventions including social distancing, contact tracing are essential to end the worldwide COVID-19. We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (I(q)) and quarantined susceptible (S(q)), collectively expressed SARII(q)S(q). A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number. Our model simulations demonstrate that the elimination of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible by combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing.

This post-translational modification and the ADP-ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) responsible for its synthesis have been found to play a role in nearly all major cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, translation, cell signaling, and cell death. Furthermore, dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation has been linked to diseases including cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and heart failure, leading to the development of therapeutic PARP inhibitors, many of which are currently in clinical trials. The study of this therapeutically important modification has recently been bolstered by the application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, arguably the most powerful tool for the unbiased analysis of protein modifications. Unfortunately, progress has been hampered by the inherent challenges that stem from the physicochemical properties of ADP-ribose, which as a post-translational modification is highly charged, heterogeneous (linear or branched polymers, as well as monomers), labile, and found on a wide range of amino acid acceptors.

Placement of blood volume sensors such as bio-impedance sensors close to the arterial sites is essential for the accurate measurement of the pulse waveform. The effect of sensor location relative to the wrist arteries on the pulse waveform had not been studied previously on human subjects. In this paper, we explore the effect of arterial and off-arterial placement of the bio-impedance sensor on important pulse waveform features such as pulse transit time (PTT), which is the travel time of the arterial pressure pulse between two sensors, and diastolic peak error (DPE), a measure of pulse signal sharpness. Placing the current injection and voltage sensing electrodes of a bio-impedance sensor on the radial artery provide greater accuracy for such features. We find that arterial PTT has a significantly lower standard deviation compared to off-arterial PTT indicating better signal quality. Similarly, we observe that DPE is much smaller for arterial bio-impedance which confirms our expectations.

BACKGROUND Mainland China had three outbreaks of SARS between November 2002-May 2004 and suffered the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most of the nursing-related literature about SARS has been reported from other countries. Researchers expect that global infections, like SARS, will persist and escalate in the future. It is important to access the guidance from nurses who cared for SARS patients in China and to uncover instructive messages which can be useful when facing global infections in the future. DESIGN Descriptive exploratory qualitative study of six Chinese nurses. METHODS Data were collected in 2003, within the three months following the nurses' quarantine necessitated by caring for SARS patients. Conventional content analysis was done using a cyberspace method of data analysis, where the geographically distant researchers conducted most phases of analysis through email communication. RESULTS Chinese nurses faced personal challenge, focused on the essence of care and experienced self-growth while caring for SARS patients. They cited structured support, meaningful disease-related information and sensitivity to the importance of a collaborative spirit as factors which enabled their caring nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS These instructive messages come from China, where the SARS epidemic inflicted an unparalleled health impact. The messages give voice to the Chinese nursing experience and when synthesised with reports from other international nurses, they enable specific direction to enhance potential for a well-prepared nursing workforce and quality patient care in future epidemics.

Absence of SR-like RNA-binding protein Slr1 slows hyphal formation and decreases virulence in a systemic candidiasis model, suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation in these processes. SR (serine-arginine)-rich proteins influence multiple steps in mRNA metabolism and their localization and function are frequently controlled by modification. We now demonstrate that Slr1 binds to polyadenylated RNA and that its intracellular localization is modulated by phosphorylation and methylation. Wildtype Slr1-GFP is predominantly nuclear, but also co-fractionates with translating ribosomes. The non-phosphorylatable slr1-6SA-GFP protein, in which six serines in SR/RS clusters are substituted with alanines, primarily localizes to the cytoplasm in budding cells. Intriguingly, hyphal cells display an slr1-6SA-GFP focus at the tip near the Spitzenkörper, a vesicular structure involved in molecular trafficking to the tip. The presence of slr1-6SA-GFP hyphal tip foci is reduced in the absence of the mRNA-transport protein She3, suggesting that unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA-protein complexes transported to the tip.

A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care — in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families.

METHODS This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 390 patients who underwent single-site laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer from January 2010 to December 2016. Antithrombotic drugs were stopped preoperatively and heparin was administered according to the operative risk of each patient, based on consultation with the cardiologist physician or neurosurgeon. Propensity score modeling was utilized to adjust for baseline characteristics. RESULTS Of 390 patients, 29 were treated with standard bridging intravenous heparin therapy. Propensity matching identified 119 patients: 22 patients in the heparinization group and 97 in the control group. The matched groups were not significantly different in operation times, bleeding volumes, or conversion rate. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 17.9 days in the heparinization group and 9.5 days in the control group (p = 0.034). Postoperative bleeding was observed in 4 patients (18.2%) in the heparinization group and 11 patients (11.4%) in the control group (p = 0.646), while other complications were similar in the two study groups (p = 0.502). Of these other complications, thromboembolic events were observed in two patients in the heparinization group and one patient in the control group.

Patients with delirium have increased risk of long-term cognitive dysfunction and mortality. The cause is unknown, which limits our ability to design therapeutic interventions. In patients undergoing surgery, low regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), is associated with postoperative neurological dysfunction (eg delirium and long-term cognitive impairment). However, the relationship between NIRS-derived rSO2 and neurological outcomes in critically ill patients is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the utilization of NIRS-derived rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating theater. We aimed to examine the relationship between rSO2 and neurological outcomes as well as to report rSO2 values in this population. METHODS The following databases were searched from inception to August 14, 2017: Ovid MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. RESULTS Of 1410 articles identified by the search strategy, 8 were ultimately selected for final review. Most (7 of 8) were published since 2014. These studies included a total of 213 patients primarily with shock or respiratory failure. A variety of devices were used to measure rSO2, including INVOS and FORESIGHT. The duration of recording varied from 5 minutes to 72 hours. Four of the 8 studies reported on neurological outcomes. In all 4 studies, rSO2 was lower in critically ill patients who were delirious compared to controls, but this was only statistically significant in 2 of the studies. The heterogeneity in devices and duration of recording precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS There is limited literature describing rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating room.

Despitea host range restricted to primates, experimental infection of rodents with certain genetically well defined poliovirus strains produces neurological disease. The outcome of infection of mice with mouse-adapted poliovirus strains has been described previously mainly in terms of paralysis and death, and it was generally assumed that these strains produce the same disease syndromes in normal mice and in mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR-tg mice). We report a comparison of the clinical course and the histopathological features of neurological disease resulting from intracerebral virus inoculation in normal micewith those of murine poliomyelitis in hPVR-tg mice. The consistent pattern of clinical deficits in poliomyelitic transgenic mice contrasted with highly variable neurologic disease that developed in mice infected with different mouse-adapted polioviruses. Histopathological analysis showed a diffuse encephalomyelitis induced by specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolates in normal mice, that affected neuronal cell populations without discrimination, whereas in hPVR-tg animals, damage was restricted to spinal motor neurons. Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type 2 differed from mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivatives in their ability to induce CNS lesions. Our findings indicate that the characteristic clinical appearance and highly specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis are mediated by the hPVR. Our data lead us to conclude that the tissue tropism of mouse-adapted poliovirus strains in normal mice is fundamentally different from that of poliovirus in hPVR-tg mice and primates, and that this is indicative of an as yet unknown mechanism of adsorption and uptake of the virus into cells of the murine CNS.",2005-03-25,"Gromeier, Matthias; Lu, Hui-Hua; Wimmer, Eckard",Microb Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/07466d0ad62aeec952044df53af8399a0dbe9799.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172458/,,en,poliomyelitis consequence poliovirus infection observe primate despitea host range restrict primate experimental infection rodent certain genetically good define poliovirus strain produce neurological disease outcome infection mouse mouse-adapted poliovirus strain describe previously mainly term paralysis death generally assume strain produce disease syndrome normal mouse mouse transgenic human poliovirus receptor hpvr-tg mouse report comparison clinical course histopathological feature neurological disease result intracerebral virus inoculation normal micewith murine poliomyelitis hpvr-tg mouse consistent pattern clinical deficit poliomyelitic transgenic mouse contrast highly variable neurologic disease develope mouse infect different mouse-adapted poliovirus histopathological analysis diffuse encephalomyelitis induce specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolate normal mouse affect neuronal cell population discrimination hpvr-tg animal damage restrict spinal motor neuron mouse neurovirulent strain poliovirus type 2 differ mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivative ability induce cns lesion finding indicate characteristic clinical appearance highly specific histopathological feature poliomyelitis mediate hpvr datum lead conclude tissue tropism mouse-adapted poliovirus strain normal mouse fundamentally different poliovirus hpvr-tg mouse primate indicative unknown mechanism adsorption uptake virus cell murine cns,164

To better understand this inefficiency, we localized the expression of Pit2, the amphotropic receptor, in polarized human airway epithelia. Pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells, suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV suggested that the apically applied virus binds to Pit2. Hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia. In this study, we demonstrated that sialic acid, keratan sulfate and collagen type V are present on the apical surface of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. While enzyme treatment reduced the abundance of these components, the treatment also decreased the transepithelial resistance to ~35% of the controls, suggesting that the epithelial integrity was impaired. To attain an airway epithelial culture with a modified apical surface and intact epithelial integrity, we utilized 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glycosylation inhibitor, to prevent the glycocalyx from reforming following enzyme treatment.

In three placentas delivered in the acute stage of SARS, there were increases in intervillous or subchorionic fibrin which might be related to disturbances in maternal placental blood flow due to the hypoxic respiratory disease. Extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) with sharply demarcated zones of avascular fibrotic villi was noted in the placentas of two patients convalescent from SARS in the third trimester. Both pregnancies had intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios and newborns small for gestation. The aetiology of the FTV might be related to thrombotic tendency due to SARS or placental hypoxia.

As with other weight loss interventions, some patients end up requiring revision to another procedure for insufficient weight loss or weight regain, discomfort, and procedure-related adverse events. OBJECTIVES In this paper, we report our technique and short-term outcomes of revisional sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) after ESG. SETTING Specialized medical center with standardized multidisciplinary protocols for medical, surgical, and endoscopic management of obesity. METHODS A combined laparoscopic-endoscopic technique that identifies plication orientation and the location of anchors and sutures was employed. This prepares the stomach for safe stapling, excluding sutures and anchors from the staple line and the retained sleeve. Hereby, we report this technique with its short-term safety and efficacy outcomes. RESULTS Twenty patients (16 female; mean age 40 ± 6 years) underwent revisional LSG from a total of 1665 (1.2%) who underwent primary ESG. Mean body mass index at the time of primary and revision procedures were 35.0 ± 4.0 and 35.2 ± 3.8 kg/m2, respectively. Nadir % total weight loss (%TWL) after primary ESG was 7.7 ± 3.5%. %TWL at 6 and 12 months after LSG was 21.0 ± 2.7 (n = 11) and 25.6 ± 4.1 (n = 8), respectively. There were no missed follow-up visits. Additionally, there was no mortality, prolonged hospital stay, adverse events, reoperations, or readmissions.

Real-life data on its safety and efficacy during a centre's early experience are sparse. Methods and results Thirty patients (28 persistent/longstanding persistent AF) underwent standalone VATS ablation for AF by an experienced thoracoscopic surgeon, with the first 20 cases proctored by external surgeons. Procedural and follow-up outcomes were collected prospectively, and compared with 90 propensity-matched patients undergoing contemporaneous catheter ablation (CA). Six (20.0%) patients undergoing VATS ablation experienced ≥1 major complication (death n = 1, stroke n = 2, conversion to sternotomy n = 3, and phrenic nerve injury n = 2). This was significantly higher than the 1.1% major complication rate (tamponade requiring drainage n = 1) seen with CA (P < 0.001). Twelve-month single procedure arrhythmia-free survival rates without antiarrhythmic drugs were 56% in the VATS and 57% in the CA cohorts (P = 0.22), and 78% and 80%, respectively given an additional CA and antiarrhythmic drugs (P = 0.32).

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control - among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a “trace & isolate” approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a “trace & isolate” approach.

We assessed the host tissue incorporation of different bioprostheses using a new tool that combines immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with differential interference contrast images, making it possible to distinguish newly formed collagen. Partial hernial defects in the abdominal wall of rabbits were repaired using cross-linked/noncross-linked bioprostheses. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) was used as control. After 14/30/90/180 days of implant, specimens were taken for microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to determine host tissue ingrowth and collagen I/III protein and 1a1/3a1 gene expression. Shrinkage and stress resistance were also examined. At 14 days, cross-linked prostheses had suffered significantly less shrinkage than ePTFE or noncross-linked prostheses. Significantly higher shrinkage was recorded for ePTFE in the longer term. Microscopy revealed encapsulation of ePTFE by neoformed tissue, while the bioprostheses became gradually infiltrated by host tissue. Noncross-linked prosthesis showed better tissue ingrowth, more intense inflammatory reaction and more rapid degradation than the cross-linked prostheses.

The psycho-immune-neuroendocrine (PINE) network comprises central nervous, immune, endocrine and autonomic systems, integrating biological mechanisms of MDD. Such networks exhibit recurrent motifs with specific functions, including positive and negative feedback loops, and are subject to critical transitions, influenced by feedback loop transitions (FLTs). AIMS We aim to identify critical feedback loops and their FLTs, as well sentinel network nodes (SNNs), key network nodes that drive FLTs, within the PINE network. Examples of biomarkers are provided which may reflect early warning signs of impending critical transition to MDD. RESULTS Disruption of homeostatic feedback loops reflects the physiological transition to MDD. Putative FLTs are identified within hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-parasympathetic axes, the kynurenine pathway, gut function and dysbiosis.

Analysis of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) using recombinant plasmid and virus infections demonstrated that the S-precursor (proS) exists as a ∼190 kDa endoplasmic reticulum form and a ∼210 kDa Golgi-modified form. ProS is subsequently processed into two C-terminal proteins of ∼110 and ∼80 kDa. The membrane-bound proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC7 or PC5B enhanced the production of the ∼80 kDa protein. In agreement, proS processing, cytopathic effects, and viral titers were enhanced in recombinant Vero E6 cells overexpressing furin, PC7 or PC5B. The convertase inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk significantly reduced proS cleavage and viral titers of SARS-CoV infected cells. In addition, inhibition of processing by dec-RVKR-cmk completely abrogated the virus-induced cellular cytopathicity. A fluorogenically quenched synthetic peptide encompassing Arg(761) of the spike glycoprotein was efficiently cleaved by furin and the cleavage was inhibited by EDTA and dec-RVKR-cmk.

The distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in this country are largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as to identify potential risk factors associated with adverse patient outcome in China, through retrospective analyses of 885 hospitalized cases with confirmed H1N1 infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proportional hazards model was employed to detect risk factors for adverse outcome; the geo-statistical maps were used to characterize the distribution of all 2668 confirmed H1N1 patients throughout mainland China. The number of new cases increased slowly in May, 2009, but rapidly between June and August of the year. Confirmed cases were reported in 26 provinces; Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujian were the top five regions of the incidence of the virus infection. After being adjusted for gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease and other general symptoms, delay for more than two days before hospital admission (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5–0.7) and delayed onset of the H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms (HR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.2–0.4) were associated with adverse patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 2009 pandemic influenza A affected east and southeast coastal provinces and most populous cities more severely than other regions in mainland China due to higher risk of high level traffic-, high population density-, and high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission.The clinical symptoms were mild in the initial phase of infection.

In the process, they can pause the elongating ribosome for regulation. An example is the stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to 3′ direction slippage of the reading-frame during elongation, by specific pseudoknot stimulators downstream of the frameshifting site. By investigating a recently identified regulatory element upstream of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) −1 frameshifting site, it is shown that a minimal functional element with hairpin forming potential is sufficient to down-regulate−1 frameshifting activity. Mutagenesis to disrupt or restore base pairs in the potential hairpin stem reveals that base-pair formation is required for−1 frameshifting attenuation in vitro and in 293T cells. The attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is determined by its stability and proximity to the frameshifting site; however, it is insensitive to E site sequence variation. Additionally, using a dual luciferase assay, it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated +1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast. The investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis-acting programmed reading-frame switch modulator. This result provides insight into mechanisms governing−1 frameshifting stimulation and attenuation. Since the upstream hairpin is unwound (by a marching ribosome) before the downstream stimulator, this study’s findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin during elongation.",2013-04-29,"Cho, Che-Pei; Lin, Szu-Chieh; Chou, Ming-Yuan; Hsu, Hsiu-Ting; Chang, Kung-Yao",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/90a7c8a2e1be47616b2f04bd011c148fcbc8adba.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3639245.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23638024/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062283,16136368.0,en,rna structure unwind decode process pause elongate ribosome regulation example stimulation -1 programme ribosomal frameshifting lead 3′ direction slippage reading-frame elongation specific pseudoknot stimulator downstream frameshifting site investigate recently identify regulatory element upstream sars coronavirus sars-cov −1 frameshifting site minimal functional element hairpin form potential sufficient down-regulate−1 frameshifting activity mutagenesis disrupt restore base pair potential hairpin stem reveal base-pair formation require for−1 frameshifting attenuation vitro 293 t cell attenuation efficiency hairpin determine stability proximity frameshifting site insensitive e site sequence variation additionally use dual luciferase assay hairpin stimulate 1 frameshifting place upstream 1 shifty site yeast investigation indicate hairpin cis-acting programme reading-frame switch modulator result provide insight mechanism governing−1 frameshifting stimulation attenuation upstream hairpin unwind march ribosome downstream stimulator study finding suggest new mode translational regulation mediate reform stem ribosomal unwind rna hairpin elongation,134

The healing process of bone fractures is greatly dependent on infiltrated macrophages. The macrophages are categorized into M1 or M2 phenotypes with different functions. This study is aimed to address the potential role of subtypes of macrophages in the process of fracture healing in patients with TBI. METHODS Twenty-five cases of clavicle fracture alone (CF group) and 22 cases of clavicle fracture concomitant with TBI (CFT group) were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Callus tissues were harvested during operations. The expressions of COX-2, CD206, and CD68 were measured with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The percentages of M2 macrophages in total macrophages increased after bone fracture in both groups, while the percentages of M1-type macrophages are decreased. Interestingly, the increased percentages of M2 macrophages are significantly higher in CFT group than in CF group. Compared to CF group, the fracture callus volume was much larger (21.9 vs 8.5 cm3) and the fracture healing time was much shorter (82.2 vs 127.0 days) in CFT group. The percentage of M2 macrophages was negatively correlated with fracture healing time in patients (r = - 0.575, p < 0.01).

We aimed to evaluate renal complications of COVID-19 and their incidence using a systematic meta-analysis. DESIGN: Observational studies reporting renal complications in COVID-19 patients were sought from MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library from 2019 to June 2020. The nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate methodological quality. Incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 22 observational cohort studies comprising of 17,391 COVID-19 patients. Quality scores of studies ranged from 4 to 6. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease was 5.2% (2.8-8.1) and 2.3% (1.8-2.8), respectively. The pooled incidence over follow-up of 2-28 days was 12.5% (10.1-15.0) for electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hyperkalaemia), 11.0% (7.4-15.1) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and 6.8% (1.0-17.0) for renal replacement therapy (RRT). In subgroup analyses, there was a higher incidence of AKI in US populations and groups with higher prevalence of pre-existing CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent renal complications reported among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are electrolyte disturbance, AKI and RRT. Aggressive monitoring and management of these renal complications may help in the prediction of favourable outcomes.

Findings suggest that the financial emergency in the global market had resulted in a watershed moment in trade credit research. About 69 % of the literature was found to have emerged after the global economic crisis of 2008. A network analysis grouped the trade credit articles into four major and four minor clusters. The banking and financing cluster exhibited the highest growth followed by the production and operation cluster while the perspectives of accounting are yet to gain traction.

There is little understanding to connect genotypes to phenotypes, and to complicate matters more, these genotypes are found throughout the world as members of mixed populations within a single host plant. There is essentially no understanding of how combinations of genotypes affect symptom expression and disease severity. We know little about the evolution of the genotypes that have been characterized to date, little about the biological role of their diversity and particularly, about the effects of recombination. Additionally, genotype grouping has not been standardized. In this study we utilized an extensive array of CTV genomic information to classify the major genotypes, and to determine the major evolutionary processes that led to their formation and subsequent retention. Our analyses suggest that three major processes act on these genotypes: (1) ancestral diversification of the major CTV lineages, followed by (2) conservation and co-evolution of the major functional domains within, though not between CTV genotypes, and (3) extensive recombination between lineages that have given rise to new genotypes that have subsequently been retained within the global population.

In this study, 3–4 day-old conventional suckling piglets were inoculated with S-INDEL PEDV Iowa106 (4 pig litters) to study its virulence. Two litters of age-matched piglets were inoculated with either the original US PEDV PC21A or mock as positive and negative controls, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs were challenged with the original US PEDV PC21A on 21–29 days post-inoculation (dpi) to assess cross-protection. All S-INDEL Iowa106- and the original US PC21A-inoculated piglets developed diarrhea. However, the severity of clinical signs, mortality (0–75%) and fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers varied among the four S-INDEL Iowa106-inoculated litters.

In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes, however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.).

DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. SETTING: Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. PATIENT(S): Not applicable (focus was on previously generated gene and protein expression data). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of cell types coexpressing the key angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes and proteins as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. RESULT(S): On the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in nonhuman primate ovarian tissue was found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but coexpression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent.

There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as the major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells.

METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of 854 patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation included in prospective series between January 2012 and March 2014. Older age (hazard ratio 1.06 for each additional year; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.11) and severe atrial enlargement (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.87) were predictors for ischemic outcome events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism) at 90 days from acute stroke. Small lesions (≤1.5 cm) were inversely correlated with both major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.39; P=0.03) and ischemic outcome events (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-1.00). We assigned to age ≥80 years 2 points and between 70 and 79 years 1 point; ischemic index lesion >1.5 cm, 1 point; severe atrial enlargement, 1 point (ALESSA score). A logistic regression with the receiver-operating characteristic graph procedure (C statistic) showed an area under the curve of 0.697 (0.632-0.763; P=0.0001) for ischemic outcome events and 0.585 (0.493-0.678; P=0.10) for major bleedings. RESULTS The validation cohort consisted of 994 patients included in prospective series between April 2014 and June 2016.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of eight patients underwent a RPDG using the E･Z Access™/LAPPROTECTOR™ (Hakko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) oval type devices with POP by a single surgeon. The median age of the patients was 66 years (range 48-75 years), and their median BMI was 22.3 kg/m2 (range 17.7-26.8 kg/m2). One (12.5 %) of eight patients was female. A thin caliber trocar MiniPort™ (Covidien, New Haven, CT) was inserted at the left upper quadrant by puncture without incision. An assistant used Endo Relief™ (Hope Denshi Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan) needlescopic forceps. In three cases, the pre-bent forceps (KTY-I, Adachi Industry Co. Ltd., Gifu, Japan) was introduced for surgeon's left hand. After the liver was retracted with a 2-0 Prolene suture, a distal subtotal resection of the stomach with D1+ or D2 lymph node dissection was performed. The Roux-en-Y method or Billroth-I anastomosis was used for reconstruction. The short-term patient outcomes were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of RPDG with POP. RESULTS We employed this technique without the use of additional trocars in every patient except one. No conversion to laparotomy was observed. Both the Endo Relief™ forceps and prebent forceps were useful to maintain countertraction and keep triangulation. The median length of the operation was 374 (range, 268-420) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 45 (range, 5-180) ml. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was 32 (range 22-46). Neither major postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1,5 days.

By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable (3,4), we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1-9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of fundoplication on esophageal transit and gastric emptying using scintigraphy studies and related these functional findings to symptomatic outcomes. METHODS A total of 106 consecutive patients (37 women, 69 men) with both preoperative and 6-month postoperative nuclear scintigraphy studies undergoing partial (Toupet) fundoplication at a single institution were analyzed. Primary variables included alterations in esophageal transit and gastric emptying times after fundoplication (1 = rapid; 2 = normal; 3 = mild delay; 4 = severe delay). Symptomatic variables included heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, pulmonary symptoms, and bloating. RESULTS Mean age was 57.2 years. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 91.5% of patients. Significant reduction of all symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, pulmonary symptoms, and dysphagia) was noted after fundoplication, except gas bloating (4.7 vs. 20.8%). There were no significant differences in preoperative and postoperative esophageal transit (2.53 vs. 2.52) and gastric emptying (2.13 vs. 2.06) scores after fundoplication. Interestingly, 17% of esophageal transit times and 18% of gastric emptying times improved after fundoplication. However, worsening scores were seen in 16 and 12%, respectively. There was no significant postoperative dysphagia, even in patients with impaired transit times. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear scintigraphic assessment of esophageal transit and gastric emptying are valuable, user-friendly tools to identify and avoid functional motility problems in the setting of fundoplication. These studies seem to be a reasonable alternative to manometry in assessing esophageal function before surgery in this setting. Postoperative symptoms may be related to objective changes in esophageal transit or gastric emptying. The causes may be iatrogenic in nature or related to vagal denervation with associated changes in esophagogastric compliance. Awareness of these physiologic changes may prompt further technical precautions at the time of surgery to avoid vagal injury and also may facilitate postoperative medical management.",2010,"Schuchert, Matthew J; Pettiford, Brian L; Abbas, Ghulam; Oostdyk, Alicia; Landreneau, James R; Kilic, Arman; Landreneau, Joshua P; Luketich, James D; Landreneau, Rodney J",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1099-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490564/,23564050.0,en,background preservation esophageal gastric function hallmark principle ensure optimal surgical outcome gastric fundoplication study evaluate impact fundoplication esophageal transit gastric use scintigraphy study relate functional finding symptomatic outcome methods total 106 consecutive patient 37 woman 69 man preoperative 6-month postoperative nuclear scintigraphy study undergo partial toupet fundoplication single institution analyze primary variable include alteration esophageal transit gastric time fundoplication 1 rapid 2 normal 3 mild delay 4 severe delay symptomatic variable include heartburn regurgitation dysphagia pulmonary symptom bloat results mean age 57.2 year symptomatic improvement achieve 91.5 patient significant reduction symptom heartburn regurgitation pulmonary symptom dysphagia note fundoplication gas bloat 4.7 vs. 20.8 significant difference preoperative postoperative esophageal transit 2.53 vs. 2.52 gastric 2.13 vs. 2.06 score fundoplication interestingly 17 esophageal transit time 18 gastric time improve fundoplication worsen score 16 12 respectively significant postoperative dysphagia patient impair transit time conclusions nuclear scintigraphic assessment esophageal transit gastric valuable user-friendly tool identify avoid functional motility problem set fundoplication study reasonable alternative manometry assess esophageal function surgery set postoperative symptom relate change esophageal transit gastric cause iatrogenic nature relate vagal denervation associate change esophagogastric compliance awareness physiologic change prompt far technical precaution time surgery avoid vagal injury facilitate postoperative medical management,199

The bat G2b-CoV isolates have an identical genome organization and share an overall genome sequence identity of 88-92 % among themselves and between them and the human/civet isolates. The most variable regions are located in the genes encoding nsp3, ORF3a, spike protein and ORF8 when bat and human/civet G2b-CoV isolates are compared.

A PEDV strain was isolated from the piglet intestinal tract in Vero cells in Jiangsu Province, designated as the JS-A strain. PEDV was identified as the isolated virus by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assay, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. The full-length genome of the JS-A isolate and the S gene were systematically analyzed, indicating that PEDV JS-A belongs to the G2a subtype, which is closely related to the prevalent PEDV in many countries and different from many current vaccines. Animal regression tests showed that piglets that are orally infected with the virus continue to develop diarrhea with yellowish and unpleasant odors. Further, piglets showed reduced food consumption and weight loss in the challenged group, while there were no abnormalities in the control group. In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I, and the downstream medium gene in the intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs infected with PEDV JS-A strain were studied. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was the only IgG transport receptor and protected IgG from degradation. Therefore, PEDV JS-A infection might inhibit FcRn expression by down-regulating TLRs and downstream signaling molecules. Taken together, isolation of the JS-A variant contributes to evolutionary analysis of the diarrhea virus. Further, the experimental infection model lays a foundation for further research related to vaccine development and the antiviral natural immune response of infected piglets, which helps us to better understand PEDV pathogenesis and immune mechanism.",2019-10-04,"Qian, Shaoju; Zhang, Weida; Jia, Xiangchao; Sun, Zhijian; Zhang, Yang; Xiao, Yuncai; Li, Zili",Front Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9cd6f7eef808b5362ce36f7b92a50cb28238136c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6788300.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636617/,203651624.0,en,porcine epidemic diarrhea ped highly infectious intestinal disease cause porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv pedv strain isolate piglet intestinal tract vero cell jiangsu province designate js-a strain pedv identify isolate virus cytopathology immunofluorescence assay western blot transmission electron microscopy sequence analysis full-length genome js-a isolate s gene systematically analyze indicate pedv js-a belong g2a subtype closely relate prevalent pedv country different current vaccine animal regression test piglet orally infect virus continue develop diarrhea yellowish unpleasant odor piglet reduce food consumption weight loss challenge group abnormality control group addition toll-like receptor tlrs rig-i downstream medium gene intestinal mucosa newborn pig infect pedv js-a strain study neonatal fc receptor fcrn igg transport receptor protect igg degradation pedv js-a infection inhibit fcrn expression down-regulating tlrs downstream signal molecule taken isolation js-a variant contribute evolutionary analysis diarrhea virus experimental infection model lay foundation far research relate vaccine development antiviral natural immune response infect piglet help understand pedv pathogenesis immune mechanism,156
79786,zqh6euc7,,Medline,Murine coronavirus requires lipid rafts for virus entry and cell-cell fusion but not for virus release.,,,16014947,unk,"Thorp and Gallagher first reported that depletion of cholesterol inhibited virus entry and cell-cell fusion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), suggesting the importance of lipid rafts in MHV replication (E. B. Thorp and T. M. Gallagher, J. Virol. 78:2682-2692, 2004). However, the MHV receptor is not present in lipid rafts, and anchoring of the MHV receptor to lipid rafts did not enhance MHV infection; thus, the mechanism of lipid rafts involvement is not clear. In this study, we defined the mechanism and extent of lipid raft involvement in MHV replication. We showed that cholesterol depletion by methyl beta-cyclodextrin or filipin did not affect virus binding but reduced virus entry. Furthermore, MHV spike protein bound to nonraftraft membrane at 4 degrees C but shifted to lipid rafts at 37 degrees C, indicating a redistribution of membrane following virus binding. Thus, the lipid raft involvement in MHV entry occurs at a step following virus binding. We also found that the viral spike protein in the plasma membrane of the infected cells was associated with lipid rafts, whereas that in the Golgi membrane, where MHV matures, was not. Moreover, the buoyant density of the virion was not changed when MHV was produced from the cholesterol-depleted cells, suggesting that MHV does not incorporate lipid rafts into the virion. These results indicate that MHV release does not involve lipid rafts. However, MHV spike protein has an inherent ability to associate with lipid rafts. Correspondingly, cell-cell fusion induced by MHV was retarded by cholesterol depletion, consistent with the association of the spike protein with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that MHV entry requires specific interactions between the spike protein and lipid rafts, probably during the virus internalization step.",2005,"Choi, Keum S; Aizaki, Hideki; Lai, Michael M C",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014947/,34524740.0,en,thorp gallagher ﻿1 report depletion cholesterol inhibit virus entry cell-cell fusion mouse hepatitis virus mhv suggest importance lipid raft mhv replication e. b. thorp t. m. gallagher j. virol 78:2682 2692 2004 mhv receptor present lipid raft anchor mhv receptor lipid raft enhance mhv infection mechanism lipid raft involvement clear study define mechanism extent lipid raft involvement mhv replication cholesterol depletion methyl beta-cyclodextrin filipin affect virus bind reduce virus entry furthermore mhv spike protein bind nonraftraft membrane 4 degree c shift lipid raft 37 degree c indicate redistribution membrane follow virus bind lipid raft involvement mhv entry occur step follow virus bind find viral spike protein plasma membrane infect cell associate lipid raft golgi membrane mhv mature buoyant density virion change mhv produce cholesterol-depleted cell suggest mhv doe incorporate lipid raft virion result indicate mhv release doe involve lipid raft mhv spike protein inherent ability associate lipid raft correspondingly cell-cell fusion induce mhv retard cholesterol depletion consistent association spike protein lipid raft plasma membrane finding suggest mhv entry require specific interaction spike protein lipid raft probably virus internalization step,179

Apparently, there is a great need for rapid detection of bioaerosols, for which air sampling often is the first critical step. However, currently available samplers often either require an external power and/or with low sampling flow rate, thus falling short of providing a practical solution when response time is of great concern. Here, we have designed and evaluated a new portable high volume bioaerosol sampler named as HighBioTrap through optimizing its operating parameters. The sampler was operated at a sampling flow rate of 1200 L/min, with an impaction velocity of about 10.2 m/s (S/W = 1.5, T/W = 1), while the weight of the sampler is about 1.9 kg. The performances of the HighBioTrap sampler were tested both in lab controlled and natural environments (outdoor and indoor environments in a university building) along with the reference sampler-the BioStage impactor using aerosolized Polystyrene (PS) uniform microspheres of various sizes, aerosolized bacteria and also ambient air particles. The microbial community structures of collected culturable bacterial aerosol particles both by the HighBioTrap and the BioStage impactor in the natural environments were analyzed using gene sequence method. Experimental results with PS particles showed the HighBioTrap has a cutoff size of ~ 2 µm. The widely used impactor design equation was found to be not applicable for predicting the performance of the HighBioTrap due to its large Reynolds number. When sampling aerosolized individual Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis bacterial particles, the HighBioTrap had physical collection efficiencies of 10% and 20%, respectively. Despite the higher desiccation effects introduced by higher flow rate, the HighBioTrap was shown to obtain a higher microbial diversity than the BioStage impactor for both in outdoor and indoor environments given the same sampling time (p < 0.01). Our data also showed that most of the desiccation effects might have occurred between 3 and 5 min of the sampling and an impaction velocity of around 10 m/s might be a close-to-optimal impaction velocity for collecting most environmental bacterial aerosols while maximally preserving their culturability. This work contributes to our understanding of microbial sampling stress (impaction velocity and sampling time), while developing a portable high volume sampler. The HighBioTrap sampler could find its great efficiencies in qualitative microbial aerosol detection and analysis, such as investigation of microbial aerosol diversity for a particular environment, or when the low level of pathogens is present and detection time is of great concern.",2017-11-28,"Chen, Haoxuan; Yao, Maosheng",J Aerosol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b329cfd44ce5114bfd4b9b562fc9f508ee6be795.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c1d4e7d169a6070e8ea201f4d7cb1f9ca5220edb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185657.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002185021730277X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002185021730277X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372770/,103717275.0,en,bioaerosols exposure lead adverse health effect result death highly infectious agent involve apparently great need rapid detection bioaerosols air sample ﻿1 critical step currently available sampler require external power and/or low sample flow rate fall short provide practical solution response time great concern design evaluate new portable high volume bioaerosol sampler highbiotrap optimize operate parameter sampler operate sample flow rate 1200 l/min impaction velocity 10.2 m/s s/w 1.5 t/w 1 weight sampler 1.9 kg performance highbiotrap sampler test lab control natural environment outdoor indoor environment university build reference sampler-the biostage impactor use aerosolized polystyrene ps uniform microsphere size aerosolized bacterium ambient air particle microbial community structure collect culturable bacterial aerosol particle highbiotrap biostage impactor natural environment analyze use gene sequence method experimental result ps particle highbiotrap cutoff size 2 µm widely use impactor design equation find applicable predict performance highbiotrap large reynolds numb sample aerosolized individual pseudomonas fluorescens bacillus subtilis bacterial particle highbiotrap physical collection efficiency 10 20 respectively despite high desiccation effect introduce high flow rate highbiotrap obtain high microbial diversity biostage impactor outdoor indoor environment sample time p 0.01 datum desiccation effect occur 3 5 min sample impaction velocity 10 m/s close-to-optimal impaction velocity collect environmental bacterial aerosol maximally preserve culturability work contribute understand microbial sample stress impaction velocity sample time develope portable high volume sampler highbiotrap sampler find great efficiency qualitative microbial aerosol detection analysis investigation microbial aerosol diversity particular environment low level pathogen present detection time great concern,242

METHODS: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS: 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6-17%) had fast breathing, and 6-13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality.

We hypothesized that the prognostic relevance of hypoproteinemia could be related to its association with impaired cardiovascular function and organ perfusion during transition. OBJECTIVES To describe the plasma protein status and the measures of cardiovascular function according to the outcome in infants <32 weeks' gestation. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight infants were prospectively included from birth to discharge. During the first 24 h of life, we assessed the cardiovascular function and systemic and organ blood flow by Doppler ultrasound, and monitored cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturation (cRSO2, rRSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy. These measures were analyzed in relationship to hypoproteinemia (total plasma protein level <40 g/L at 12 h of life) and severe adverse outcome (death or survival with severe neurological injury). RESULTS Hypoproteinemia was associated with a higher risk of a severe adverse outcome after adjustment of confounding variables (adjusted OR = 6.8; 95% CI 1.3-34). Compared to normoproteinemic infants and after adjustment for gestational age, hypoproteinemic ones had more significantly: hypotension (7 vs. 13%, p = 0.03), abnormal capillary refilling time (20 vs. 36%, p < 0.001), abnormal renal blood flow (resistive index 0.78 ± 0.11 vs. 0.85 ± 0.09, p = 0.04), lower rRSO2 (82.9 ± 9.2 vs. 73.6 ± 10.5%, p = 0.04), and lower systemic vascular resistance (0.155 ± 0.058 vs. 0.108 ± 0.037 mm Hg/L/kg; p = 0.04). The cRSO2 patterns were significantly decreased in infants with severe adverse outcome and independent from protein status.

Objectives: To describe the current etiology of CAP in Malawi and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR. Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4–41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17–5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40–5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48–6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03–9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72–7.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens.

NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS: Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome.

Corticosteroid use in influenza is widespread, non-systematic and marked by controversy. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of adjuvant corticosteroids in influenza found an association with increased mortality but there were important concerns regarding the risks of bias. OBJECTIVES To (1) evaluate whether or not low-dose corticosteroids given as an adjunct to standard treatment is beneficial in patients who are hospitalised with severe pandemic influenza and (2) develop an 'off-the-shelf' clinical trial that is ready to be activated in a future pandemic. DESIGN Multicentre, pragmatic, blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Thirty to 40 hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS Adults (≥ 16 years) admitted to hospital with an influenza-like illness during a pandemic. INTERVENTION Five-day course of dexamethasone (Dexsol®, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd) 6 mg daily, started within 24 hours of admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Admission to Intensive Care Unit, or death, within 30 days of admission to hospital. RESULTS This trial has not yet been activated. It is currently set up with full ethics and regulatory approvals in place, ready for rapid activation at the onset of the next pandemic. Hurdles to setting up a pandemic trial include planning for pandemic-level pressures on UK NHS resources and co-enrolment of patients to multiple pandemic studies, ensuring adequate geographical distribution of participating sites, maintaining long-term low-level engagement with site investigators, addressing future trial-specific training needs of local investigators and resilience planning in trial management. Identified threats to trial delivery include changes to research capabilities or policies during the hibernation phase, lack of staff resources during a pandemic and the influence of media at the time of a pandemic. A mismatch in the approach to informed consent required by current regulations to that preferred by patients and the public was identified. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that advance set-up of a trial to be conducted during a pandemic, with full regulatory approvals in place, is possible. Regular review during the hibernation phase will be required. This study serves as a model for the development of other 'off-the-shelf' trials as part of preparedness planning for public health emergencies.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease.

Guanines of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) bound with thrombin do not react with 3,4,5-trimethoxylphenylglyoxal (TMPG) in the presence of tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide (TPA), whereas guanines of free TBA- and TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide rapidly react with TMPG to emit light. Thus, guanine chemiluminescence in 5% human serum with thrombin was lower than that without thrombin when TBA-conjugated 6-FAM was added in two samples and incubated for 20min. In other words, the brightness of guanine chemiluminescence was quenched due to the formation of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated 6-FAM bound with thrombin in a sample. High-energy intermediate, capable of emitting dim light by itself, formed from the reaction between guanines of TBA and TMPG in the presence of TPA, transfers energy to 6-FAM to emit bright light based on the principle of chemiluminescence energy transfer (CRET). G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor devised using the rapid interaction between TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and thrombin quantified trace levels of thrombin without complicated procedures. The limit of detection (LOD=background+3×standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with good linear calibration curve, accuracy, precision, and recovery was as low as 12.3nM in 5% human serum.

As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one‐off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse‐textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse‐textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non‐clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable.

In the United States, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted and about 20,000 die from acute pancreatitis per year. In Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the global budgeting system on health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care among patients with acute pancreatitis in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used for analysis. Data on patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed during the period 2000 and 2001 were used as baseline data, and data from 2004 and 2005 were used as post-intervention data. The length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug cost, therapy costs, total costs, risk of readmission within 14 days, and risk of revisiting the emergency department (ED) within 3 days of discharge before and after implementation of the global budgeting system were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Data on 2810 patients with acute pancreatitis were analyzed in this study.

As mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the evolutionary trajectories of viruses—and possibly of their epidemiological potential.",2019-07-24,"Aris-Brosou, Stéphane; Parent, Louis; Ibeh, Neke",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/990adafb33c7402d0a1753fb05c351e6bf7fc80d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6722887.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722887/,,en,viruses know high diverse mutation rate find biological replicator single-stranded s rna virus evolve fast double-stranded d dna virus rate approach bacterium mutation rate tightly negative correlate genome size selection clear driver viral evolution role intragenomic interaction driver viral evolution unclear understand process affect long-term evolution virus infect human comprehensively analyze ssrna ssdna dsrna dsdna virus find virus type function evidence episodic diversify selection correlate evolution selection affect single strand virus correlate evolution prevalent dna virus process independently affect viral replication gene jointly affect process involve key aspect life cycle favor viral stability proliferation far evolutionary process intimately link amino acid level suggest joint action selection correlate evolution selection shape evolutionary trajectory virus — possibly epidemiological potential,117

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mbrABCD-related bacitracin resistance mechanism of S. mutans. Transcriptome data demonstrated that the expression levels of 33 genes were induced more than twofold by bacitracin. Fourteen genes were selected from the upregulated genes, and defective mutants of these genes were constructed for measurement of their sensitivity to bacitracin. Among the mutants, only the mbrA- or mbrB-deficient mutants exhibited 100- to 121-fold greater sensitivity to bacitracin when compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, knockout of the mbrC and mbrD genes abolished the bacitracin-induced mbrAB upregulation. These results suggest that both mbrC and mbrD are required for mbrAB upregulation that confers the bacitracin-resistant phenotype on S. mutans.

Differential diagnosis of PECs relies on laboratory methods. This study describes the development of an ELISA-like multiplex planar immunoassay based on virus-specific recombinant S1 proteins printed in an array of spots at the bottom of a 96-well microplate for simultaneous detection differential serodiagnosis of PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV in a single sample. The technology overall format and working principle is similar to the solid-phase standard ELISA. After the three typical incubation steps, the reaction was visualized as blue spots which intensity correlated with antibody levels to specific viral antigen target in the array. The diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated on known status serum samples (n = 480) collected over time (day post-inoculation -7, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42) from pigs inoculated with PEDV, TGEV Purdue, TGEV Miller, PDCoV (USA/IL/2014), or mock inoculated with culture media under experimental conditions. Antigen-specific cut-offs were selected to ensure 100% diagnostic and analytical specificity for each given antigen target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity was 92% (44/48 positives, 95% confidence interval (CI) 98,100) for PEDV S1, 100% (95/95 positives, 95% CI 98, 100) for TGEV S1, and 98% (47/48 positives, 95% CI 97, 100) for PDCoV S1.

Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the impacts of coinfection on disease severity are less understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in Nepal. Prospective weekly household-based active surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RT-PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses detected as part of the same illness episode. RESULTS: Of 1730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected in their primary illness episode. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. The cohort of infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting &#8805; 4 days (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and so did the subset of coinfected infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7).

However, other researchers have not only challenged this assumption, but also proposed that spirit possession has transformative benefits. The idiom of spirit possession provides cultural meanings for spirit mediums and shamans to express and transform their personal experiences. The present case study focuses on dang-ki healing, a form of Chinese mediumship practiced in Singapore, in which a deity possesses a human (i.e., dang-ki) to offer aid to supplicants. This study seeks to explore whether involvement in dang-ki healing is transformative; and if so, how the dang-ki's transformation is related to his self and the perceived legitimacy of his mediumship. At a shrine, I interviewed 20 participants, including a male dang-ki, 10 temple assistants, and nine clients. The results obtained were supportive of the therapeutic nature of spirit possession. First, there is a relationship between his self-transformation and the perceived legitimacy of his mediumship. As his clients and community have recognized his spirit possession as genuine, and the healing power of his possessing god, he is able to make use of mediumship as a means for spiritual development. Second, he has developed his spirituality by internalizing his god's positive traits (e.g., compassion). Deities worshipped in dang-ki healing can be conceptualized as ideal selves who represent a wide range of positive traits and moral values of Chinese culture. Thus, the possession of a deity is the embodiment of an ideal self. Finally, the dang-ki's transformation may run parallel to his god's transformation. In Chinese religions, gods have to constantly develop their spirituality even though they are already gods.

Both hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is harmful to the host. The inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. All pathogens with sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis, after they succeed to adhere and pass the mucosal barrier of the host. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Through several signaling pathways, overstimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. Hyperinflammation is characterized by activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. The release of endogenous molecules by injured cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, leads to deterioration in a vicious cycle by further stimulation of PRRs. Features of immune suppression are massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes.",2017-12-28,"van Engelen, Tjitske S.

METHODS ARAMIS was first compared with two transanal minimally invasive surgery platforms (SILS Port and GelPOINT Path) on human cadavers. Surgeons with different experience performed running sutures at different distances, at four quadrants, using the three platforms and gave a score to visibility, safety, and maneuverability. ARAMIS was then utilized on patients affected with rectal neoplasia who met the inclusion criteria. Patients and tumor characteristic and results were prospectively collected. The follow-up examinations included proctoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS According to surgeons' scores, ARAMIS improves visibility and safety with respect to other platforms for distances beyond 10 cm. The procedure, which lasted an average of 59 min, was successfully carried out in 14 patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported. The mean tumor size was 3 cm; they were located a mean of 11 cm from the anal verge. Complete removal of the lesion was possible in 13/14 patients. There was one case of adenoma recurrence at follow-up. CONCLUSION Study results showed that ARAMIS, which is equipped with an adjustable rectoscope, can be considered a safe, effective platform for transanal surgery.

Numerous ribonucleoproteins were released from purified tubes disrupted in vitro. Actin and myosin I were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in isolated tubes while actin and the viral NSm non‐structural protein were detected in the tubes' internal proteinaceous scaffold by immunogold labelling.

A circular stapler often is used for B-I gastroduodenostomy in open and laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy. Recently, totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) has been considered less invasive than laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy, and many institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy are trying to progress to TLDG without markedly changing the anastomosis method. The purpose of this report is to introduce the technical details of new methods of intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy using either a circular or linear stapler and to evaluate their technical feasibility and safety. METHODS Seventeen patients who underwent TLDG with the intracorporeal double-stapling technique using a circular stapler (n = 7) or the book-binding technique (BBT) using a linear stapler (n = 10) between February 2010 and April 2011 were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathological data, surgical data, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery in any of the 17 patients. The usual postoperative complications following gastroduodenostomy, such as anastomotic leakage and stenosis, were not observed. Anastomosis took significantly longer to complete with DST (64 ± 24 min) than with BBT (34 ± 7 min), but more stapler cartridges were needed with BBT than with DST. CONCLUSIONS TLDG using a circular or linear stapler is feasible and safe to perform. DST will enable institutions performing laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy with circular staplers to progress to TLDG without problems, and this progression may be more economical because fewer stapler cartridges are used during surgery. However, if an institution has already been performing δ anastomosis in TLDG but has been experiencing certain issues with δ anastomosis, converting from δ anastomosis to BBT should be beneficial.",2013,"Ikeda, Tetsuo; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Hisamatsu, Yuichi; Ando, Koji; Saeki, Hiroshi; Oki, Eiji; Ohga, Takefumi; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Tsujitani, Shunichi; Kohnoe, Shunji; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2433-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22733199/,13527917.0,en,background billroth b-i gastroduodenostomy anastomotic procedure widely perform gastric resection distal gastric cancer circular stapler use b-i gastroduodenostomy open laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy recently totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy tldg consider little invasive laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy institution perform laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy try progress tldg markedly change anastomosis method purpose report introduce technical detail new method intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy use circular linear stapler evaluate technical feasibility safety methods seventeen patient undergo tldg intracorporeal double-stapling technique use circular stapler n 7 book-binding technique bbt use linear stapler n 10 february 2010 april 2011 enroll study clinicopathological datum surgical datum postoperative outcome analyze results intraoperative complication conversion open surgery 17 patient usual postoperative complication follow gastroduodenostomy anastomotic leakage stenosis observe anastomosis significantly long complete dst 64 ± 24 min bbt 34 ± 7 min stapler cartridge need bbt dst conclusions tldg use circular linear stapler feasible safe perform dst enable institution perform laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy circular stapler progress tldg problem progression economical stapler cartridge use surgery institution perform δ anastomosis tldg experience certain issue δ anastomosis convert δ anastomosis bbt beneficial,174

For HTS to be most successful, it is our contention that there must exist an early partnership between biologists and medicinal chemists. Their combined skill sets are necessary to design robust assays and efficient workflows that will weed out assay artifacts, false positives, promiscuous bioactive compounds and intractable screening hits, efforts that ultimately give projects a better chance at identifying truly useful chemical matter.

Passive immunization with MAb ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice, and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge. In a cynomolgus macaque model, reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with MAb ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge.

It is estimated that up to 88% of patients with emphysema have at least 1 incomplete interlobar fissure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of creating a complete fissure with stapling via minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) followed by bronchoscopic valve placement to induce lobar collapse in a swine model. METHODS Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on 2 swine and at least 1 target incomplete fissure was identified. Both swine underwent VATS to complete the target fissure using a surgical stapler, followed by bronchoscopic placement of the Spiration endobronchial valves. A chest CT scan was performed immediately postprocedure. Follow-up bronchoscopy and CT scans were performed 2 weeks after the initial procedure prior to sacrifice. RESULTS Successful fissure completion was accomplished using VATS and confirmed at postmortem explanted lung gross examination. Flexible bronchoscopy 2 weeks following valve placement showed proper positioning of the valves. Effectiveness of combined procedures was confirmed by a chest CT scan that showed complete atelectasis of the target lobe at 2-week follow-up. There was no perioperative or postoperative morbidity or mortality.

Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species.

About the latter, hypertension and coronary heart disease are among the most common comorbidities recorded in infected patients, together with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data from Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS, Italy) show that more than 68.3% of patients had hypertension, 28.2% ischemic heart disease, 22.5% atrial fibrillation, while 30.1% T2DM. Several authors suggested that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus are linked to endothelial dysfunction, and all of them are strictly related to aging. Considering the impact of the gender on the COVID-19 epidemic, even if confirmed cases from each nation are changing every day, epidemiological data clearly evidence that in men the infection causes worse outcomes compared to women. In Italy, up to 21 May, in the age range of 60-89 years, male deaths were 63.9% of total cases. The reason behind this difference between genders appears not clear; however, the diversity in sex-hormones and styles of life are believed to play a role in the patient's susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. It is known that the activation of endothelial estrogen receptors increases NO and decreases ROS, protecting the vascular system from angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, inflammation, and ROS production. During the pandemic, joining forces is vital; thus, as people help doctors by limiting their displacements out of their houses avoiding hence the spread of the infection, doctors help patients to overcome severe SARS-CoV-2 infections by using multiple pharmacological approaches.

General George Washington ordered the entire American army to be variolated against smallpox after recognizing the serious threat that it posed to military operations. He did this on the recommendation from Dr. John Morgan, the physician-in-chief of the American army, who wrote a treatise on variolation in 1776. Although cases of smallpox still occurred, they were far fewer than expected, and it is believed that the vaccination program contributed to victory in the War of Independence. Effective military force requires personnel who are healthy and combat ready for worldwide deployment. Given the geography of US military operations, military personnel should also be protected against diseases that are endemic in potential areas of conflict. For this reason, and unknown to many, the US military has strongly supported vaccine research and development. Four categories of communicable infectious diseases threaten military personnel: (1) diseases that spread easily in densely populated areas (respiratory and dysenteric diseases); (2) vector-borne diseases (disease carried by mosquitoes and other insects); (3) sexually transmitted diseases (hepatitis, HIV, and gonorrhea); and (4) diseases associated with biological warfare. For each category, the US military has supported research that has provided the basis for many of the vaccines available today. Although preventive measures and the development of drugs have provided some relief from the burden of malaria, dengue, and HIV, the US military continues to fund research and development of prophylactic vaccines that will contribute to force health protection and global health. In the past few years, newly recognized infections with Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses have pushed the US military to fund research and fast track clinical trials to quickly and effectively develop vaccines for emerging diseases.

RESULTS: Elevated neutrophil-to-LYM ratio (NLR), D-dimer(D-D), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, interferon-Y, and age were significantly associated with the severity of illness. However, significant and sustained decreases were observed in the LYM subset (p<0.05). D-D, T cell counts, and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of mild cases. Second, D-D increased from 0.5 to 8, and the risk ratio increased from 2.75 to 55, eventually leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, the acute renal function damage occurred earlier than abnormal heart and liver functions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The degrees of lymphopenia and proinflammatory cytokine storm were higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases. The degree was associated with the disease severity. Advanced age, NLR, D-D, and cytokine levels may serve as useful prognostic factors for the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 93 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The samples were examined for lymphocyte (LYM) subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the best diagnostic thresholds for laboratory results, and principal component analysis was used to screen the major risk factors.

METHODS: Consecutive adults (>18 years old) who attended for pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination were eligible to complete an anonymous questionnaire with closed answers to evaluate their level of knowledge about MERS-CoV. To evaluate the effectiveness of the information given during the consultation, the same questionnaire was completed by the Hajj pilgrim before and after the consultation, where the information about MERS-CoV was provided. RESULTS: Among 82 Hajj pilgrim adults enrolled in the study, less than 25% were aware of the routes of transmission, symptoms and preventive behaviours to adopt abroad or in case of fever. Pilgrims had a higher rate of correct responses on each question at the time they completed the second questionnaire, as compared with the first, with 11 of 13 questions answered significantly better after delivery of educational information about MERS-CoV. However, although the rate of correct answers to the questions about routes of transmission, symptoms, preventive behaviours to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential MERS-CoV occurrence increased significantly after receiving the information, the rates remained below 50%.

The healing properties of Betula bark and bark extracts have been known for a long time in traditional medicine in different parts of the world. Several species of Betula have traditionally been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases including arthritis. The purpose of this review is to provide updated, comprehensive and categorized information on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological and toxicological research of Betula species in order to explore their therapeutic potential and evaluate future research opportunities. Materials and methods All the available information on various species belonging to the genus Betula was collected via electronic search (using Pubmed, SciFinder, Scirus, Google Scholar, JCCC@INSTIRC and Web of Science) and a library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Results Although over a hundred Betula species are found distributed globally, about 7 different species of Betula have been documented for their traditional uses. Phytochemical research on Betula species has led to the isolation of triterpenoids, diarylheptanoids, phenylbutanoids, lignans, phenolics and flavonoids. Crude extracts, fractions and phytochemical constituents isolated from Betula showed a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities like immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, antidiabetic, dermatological, gastroprotective and hepatoprotective. Antiarthritic and anticancer are the two major areas of research conducted on these species. The anti-carcinogenic effects of Betula bark, betulin as well as betulinic acid have been extensively studied. Conclusions Several species belonging to the genus Betula are widely used in traditional medicine. Betula platyphylla and Betula pendula have specifically been found to be potentially useful in the treatment of degenerative joint disease. There is convincing evidence in experimental animal models in support of their anti-carcinogenic effects.

Several technologies have been designed to improve cellular uptake of therapeutic molecules, including cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). CPPs were first discovered based on the potency of several proteins to enter cells. Numerous CPPs have been described so far, which can be grouped into two major classes, the first requiring chemical linkage with the drug for cellular internalization and the second involving formation of stable, non-covalent complexes with drugs. Nowadays, CPPs constitute very promising tools for non-invasive cellular import of cargo and have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo delivery of therapeutic molecules varying from small chemical molecule, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, liposomes and particles. This review will focus on the structure/function and cellular uptake mechanism of CPPs in the general context of drug delivery. We will also highlight the application of peptide carriers for the delivery of therapeutic molecules and provide an update of their clinical evaluation.

125739,gz3stv4l,,WHO,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.",2020,"Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,#99645,,,,,215769567.0,en,novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak demonstrate importance renin-angiotensin system ras patient diabetes activation ras increase patient diabetes virus attache ace2 enzyme low cytosolic ph value enter cell cause infection especially presence diabetes mellitus accompany comorbid condition hypertension obesity old age smoke cytosolic ph low virus easily enter cell attach ace2 aceis arbs lead reduction angiotensin ii level increase ace2 level cause low cytosolic ph. increased cardiac ace2 level aceis arbs trigger cardiac arrhythmia myocarditis cause virus easily enter heart tissue ace2 activity rostral ventrolateral medulla brain stem release angiotensin 1 7 brain stem lead activation sympathetic nervous system activation cause systemic vasoconstriction patient blood pressure increase important event increase sympathetic activity central stimulation activity increase pulmonary capillary leak cause ards cytosolic ph low patient diabetes decrease far mechanism mention viral load increase infection exacerbate result use aceis arbs patient diabetes lead increase morbidity mortality covid-19,146
57875,jxhz2zin,,Medline,Pneumocephalus patterns following endonasal endoscopic skull base surgery as predictors of postoperative CSF leaks.,10.3171/2014.5.jns132028,,24995788,unk,"OBJECTIVES Postoperative pneumocephalus is a common occurrence after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS). The risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can be high and the presence of postoperative pneumocephalus associated with serosanguineous nasal drainage may raise suspicion for a CSF leak. The authors hypothesized that specific patterns of pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging could be predictive of CSF leaks. Identification of these patterns could guide the postoperative management of patients undergoing ESBS. METHODS The authors queried a prospectively acquired database of 526 consecutive ESBS cases at a single center between December 1, 2003, and May 31, 2012, and identified 258 patients with an intraoperative CSF leak documented using intrathecal fluorescein. Postoperative CT and MRI scans obtained within 1-10 days were examined and pneumocephalus was graded based on location and amount. A discrete 0-4 scale was used to classify pneumocephalus patterns based on size and morphology. Pneumocephalus was correlated with the surgical approach, histopathological diagnosis, and presence of a postoperative CSF leak. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 56.7 months. Of the 258 patients, 102 (39.5%) demonstrated pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging. The most frequent location of pneumocephalus was frontal (73 [71.5%] of 102), intraventricular (34 [33.3%]), and convexity (22 [21.6%]). Patients with craniopharyngioma (27 [87%] of 31) and meningioma (23 [68%] of 34) had the highest incidence of postoperative pneumocephalus compared with patients with pituitary adenomas (29 [20.6%] of 141) (p < 0.0001). The incidence of pneumocephalus was higher with transcribriform and transethmoidal approaches (8 of [73%] 11) than with a transsellar approach (9 of [7%] 131). There were 15 (5.8%) of 258 cases of postoperative CSF leak, of which 10 (66.7%) had pneumocephalus, compared with 92 (38%) of 243 patients without a postoperative CSF leak (OR 3.3, p = 0.027). Pneumocephalus located in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sellar region, parasellar region, and perimesencephalic region was significantly correlated with a postoperative CSF leak (OR 4.9, p = 0.006) and was therefore termed ""suspicious"" pneumocephalus. In contrast, frontal or intraventricular pneumocephalus was not correlated with postoperative CSF leak (not significant) and was defined as ""benign"" pneumocephalus. The amount of convexity pneumocephalus (p = 0.002), interhemispheric pneumocephalus (p = 0.005), and parasellar pneumocephalus (p = 0.007) (determined using a scale score of 0-4) was also significantly related to postoperative CSF leaks. Using a series of permutation-based multivariate analyses, the authors established that a model containing the learning curve, the transclival/transcavernous approach, and the presence of ""suspicious"" pneumocephalus provides the best overall prediction for postoperative CSF leaks. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative pneumocephalus is much more common following extended approaches than following transsellar surgery.

Several viral/bacterial agents are responsible for BRD, and interactions occur among the agents. Viral agents often predispose animals to bacterial infections, and Mannheimia haemolytica is the most frequently isolated organism in cattle with BRD. Laboratory tests are available to characterize organisms causing BRD using easily obtained nasal swab samples. Testing for persistent infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus can be done by a 2-stage technique using PCR and immunohistochemistry. Preconditioning programs that include preweaning viral vaccination programs along with castration could have a significant influence on decreasing BRD in the cattle feeding industry. Metaphylactic antibiotic programs continue to be effective; however, antibiotic resistance is a public concern, and additional management options (e.g., direct-fed microbials or other compounds with antimicrobial properties) deserve attention. Diets with an increased energy concentration achieved by decreasing the dietary roughage concentration may slightly increase the rate of BRD morbidity; however, these diets also increase ADG, DMI, and G:F compared with lower-energy, greater-roughage diets. The extent to which performance and BRD morbidity are affected by dietary protein concentration needs further study, but low and high protein concentrations should probably be avoided. Several trace minerals (e.g., Cu, Se, and Zn) affect immune function, but the effects of supplementation on performance and immune function in model challenge systems and in field studies are equivocal. Adding vitamin E to receiving diets at pharmacological levels (e.g., >1,000 IU·animal(−1)·day(−1)) seems beneficial for decreasing BRD morbidity, but it has little effect on performance. Given the limited ability to consistently modify immune function and BRD morbidity through dietary manipulations, we recommend that the diets for newly received cattle be formulated to adjust nutrient concentrations for low feed intake and to provide optimal performance during the receiving period.",2007-03-21,"Duff, G.

We report our rate of hemorrhagic complications after endovascular treatment and analyze the clinical significance and potential mechanisms, with emphasis on cases of delayed hemorrhage after uneventful embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS During a 10-year period, 846 embolization procedures were performed in 408 patients with brain AVMs. Any cases of hemorrhagic complications were identified and divided into those related or unrelated to a periprocedural arterial tear (during catheter navigation or catheter retrieval). We analyzed the following variables: sex, age, hemorrhagic presentation, Spetzler-Martin grade, size of the AVM, number of embolized pedicles, microcatheter used, type and volume of liquid embolic agent injected, and the presence of a premature venous occlusion. Univariate and multivariate multiple regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for hemorrhagic complications. RESULTS A hemorrhagic complication occurred in 92 (11%) procedures. Forty-four (48%) complications were related to a periprocedural arterial perforation, and 48 (52%) were not. Hemorrhagic complications unrelated to an arterial perforation were located more commonly in the cerebral parenchyma, caused more neurologic deficits, and were associated with worse prognosis than those in the arterial perforation group. Only premature venous occlusion was identified as an independent predictor of hemorrhagic complication in the nonperforation group. Premature venous occlusion was significantly related to the ratio of Onyx volume to nidus diameter.

Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG(2)) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood.

However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D(G64S), has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D(G64S) populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D(G64S) under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D(G64S) exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D(G64S) growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.",2018-06-28,"Fitzsimmons, William J.; Woods, Robert J.; McCrone, John T.; Woodman, Andrew; Arnold, Jamie J.; Yennawar, Madhumita; Evans, Richard; Cameron, Craig E.; Lauring, Adam S.",PLoS Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/59cdfbf3b9e99d780b3ad6cf2985e34ec61e8f5a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6040757.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6040757/,,en,mutation rate evolve genetic drift indirect selection genetic hitchhike direct selection physicochemical cost high fidelity system difficult disentangle relative impact force empirically rna virus observe correlation mutation rate virulence lead argue extremely high mutation rate advantageous allow increase adaptability argument profound implication suggest pathogenesis viral infection depend rare de novo mutation present datum alternative model rna virus evolve high mutation rate byproduct selection increase replicative speed find poliovirus antimutator 3d(g64s significant replication defect wild-type wt 3d(g64s population similar adaptability 2 distinct cellular environment experimental evolution 3d(g64s selection replicative speed lead reversion compensation fidelity phenotype mice infect 3d(g64s exhibit delay morbidity dose good lethal level consistent attenuation slow growth oppose reduce mutational supply furthermore compensation 3d(g64s growth defect restore virulence compensation fidelity phenotype datum consistent kinetic proofread model biosynthetic reaction suggest speed important accuracy contrast suggest rna virus find within-host spread associate viral replicative speed stand genetic diversity,147

Our focus is on trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases, rather than cumulative cases, as trajectories help us identify trends in how the pandemic naturally develops over time, and study the shapes of the curve in different states. Methods: We analyzed data on daily reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from January 21 to June 16, 2020 in 50 states, adjusted for the population size of each state. Cluster analysis for time-series data was used to split the states into clusters that have distinct trajectories of daily cases. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare access between clusters were tested. Adjusted models were used to determine if healthcare access is associated with reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Results: Two clusters of states were identified. One cluster had a high trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases, and comprised of 19 states, including New York and New Jersey. The other cluster of states (n=31) had a low trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases. There were significantly more Black residents (p=0.027) and more nursing facility residents (p=0.001) in states reporting high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. States reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases also had fewer uninsured persons (p=0.005), fewer persons who reported having to forgo medical care due to cost (p=0.016), more registered physicians (p=0.002) and more nurses (p=0.03), higher health spending per capita (p=0.01), fewer residents in Health Professional Shortage Areas per 100,000 population (p=0.027), and higher adoption of Medicaid Expansion (p=0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted. One hundred and seven patients who underwent pelvic embolization between January 2003 and December 2013 were included. Patient demographics, ISS, angiography techniques, and major complications including gluteal and skin necrosis, wound breakdown, and deep infection were compared. RESULTS Nine patients (8.4 %) developed major complications after undergoing TAE. This rate dropped to 5.1 % after exclusion of patients with Morel-Lavallee lesions. Nonselective embolization trended toward a higher complication rate compared to superselective embolization. Patients who developed complications were more likely to have undergone pelvic surgery. CONCLUSION The majority of patients who developed complications had nonselective TAE. Morel-Lavallee lesions are a confounding factor, but TAE may impose an additional risk.

During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas.

Our study demonstrated the following characteristics: Infected neuronal and glial cells produced viral nucleocapsid and E2 glycoprotein. The synthesis of these viral structural proteins was not restricted to cells in any particular part of the central nervous system. While JHM E2 proteins could be detected in individual cells of JHM-infected CNS tissue, the relative level of detectable E2 protein in the total CNS tissue of infected rats was reduced by more than 13-fold compared with JHM-infected tissue culture cells.

105282,5d0gev9e,,WHO,An international multicentre study of protocols for liver transplantation during a pandemic: A case for quadripartite equipoise,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Covid-19 has vastly increased the operational burden on healthcare systems worldwide. For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multi-center study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the Quadripartite Equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a ""sickest-first"" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - Recipient Outcome, Donor/Graft Safety, Waiting List Mortality and Healthcare Resources for seven countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of Quadripartite Equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic.

A controlled human infection model (CHIM) would accelerate the efficacy assessment of candidate vaccines. This strategy would require deliberate exposure of volunteers to SARSCoV2 with no currently available treatment and a small but definite risk of serious illness or death. This raises complex questions about the social and ethical acceptability of risk to individuals, given the potential benefit to the wider population, and as such, a study cannot be done without public involvement. We conducted a structured public consultation with 57 individuals aged 20–40 years to understand public attitudes to a CHIM, and pre-requisites for enrolment. The overall response to this strategy was positive, and many would volunteer altruistically. Carefully controlled infection is viewed as safer than natural exposure to wild virus. The prolonged social isolation required for the proposed CHIM is considered an obstacle but not insurmountable, with reasonable compensation and supportive care. Given the significant level of public interest, a CHIM should be done as open science with regular, controlled dissemination of information into the public domain.

39276,yj2dfykl,,Medline,Concentric and Eccentric Pedaling-Type Interval Exercise on a Soft Robot for Stable Coronary Artery Disease Patients: Toward a Personalized Protocol.,10.2196/10970,,30916659,unk,"BACKGROUND Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide, and coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common causes of death in Europe. Leading cardiac societies recommend exercise as an integral part of cardiovascular rehabilitation because it reduces the morbidity and mortality of patients with CAD. Continuous low-intensity exercise using shortening muscle actions (concentric, CON) is a common training modality during cardiovascular rehabilitation. However, a growing clinical interest has been recently developed in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for stable patients with CAD. Exercise performed with lengthening muscle actions (eccentric, ECC) could be tolerated better by patients with CAD as they can be performed with higher loads and lower metabolic cost than CON exercise. OBJECTIVE We developed a clinical protocol on a soft robot to compare cardiovascular and muscle effects of repeated and work-matched CON versus ECC pedaling-type interval exercise between patients with CAD during cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study aims to ascertain whether the developed training protocols affect peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), peak aerobic power output (Ppeak), and parameters of muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) during exercise, and anaerobic muscle power. METHODS We will randomize 20-30 subjects to either the CON or ECC group. Both groups will perform a ramp test to exhaustion before and after the training period to measure cardiovascular parameters and SmO2. Moreover, the aerobic skeletal muscle power (Ppeak) is measured weekly during the 8-week training period using a simulated squat jump and a counter movement jump on the soft robot and used to adjust the training load. The pedaling-type interval exercise on the soft robot is performed involving either CON or ECC muscle actions. The soft robotic device being used is a closed kinetic chain, force-controlled interactive training, and testing device for the lower extremities, which consists of two independent pedals and free footplates that are operated by pneumatic artificial muscles. RESULTS The first patients with CAD, who completed the training, showed protocol-specific improvements, reflecting, in part, the lower aerobic training status of the patient completing the CON protocol. Rehabilitation under the CON protocol, more than under the ECC protocol, improved cardiovascular parameters, that is, VO2peak (+26% vs -6%), and Ppeak (+20% vs 0%), and exaggerated muscle deoxygenation during the ramp test (248% vs 49%). Conversely, markers of metabolic stress and recovery from the exhaustive ramp test improved more after the ECC than the CON protocol, that is, peak blood lactate (-9% vs +20%) and peak SmO2 (+7% vs -7%). Anaerobic muscle power only improved after the CON protocol (+18% vs -15%). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates the potential of the implemented CON and ECC protocols of pedaling-type interval exercise to improve oxygen metabolism of exercised muscle groups while maintaining or even increasing the Ppeak. The ECC training protocol seemingly provided a lower cardiovascular stimulus in patients with CAD while specifically enhancing the reoxygenation and blood lactate clearance in recruited muscle groups during recovery from exercise.

Here, we reported that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection induced significant up-regulation of miR-223 in murine macrophages. We observed that miR-223 overexpression up-regulated type I IFN expression levels in VSV-infected macrophages. We also demonstrated that miR-223 directly targets FOXO3 to regulate the type I IFN production. Furthermore, type I IFN, which is triggered by VSV infection, is responsible for the up-regulation of miR-223, thus forming a positive regulatory loop for type I IFN production.

However, when a particles-laden droplet on a solid surface is vaporized, a cluster-ring deposit is often yielded which makes particles counting difficult or impractical. Nevertheless, in this study, we present an approach, i.e., on-cantilever particles imprinting, which effectively defies such odds to sample and deposit countable single particles on a sensing surface. Initially, we designed and fabricated a triangular microcantilever sensor whose mass m(0), total beam-length L, and clamped-end beam-width w are equivalent to that of a rectangular/normal cantilever but with a higher resonant frequency (271 kHz), enhanced sensitivity (0.13 Hz/pg), and quality factor (~3000). To imprint particles on these cantilever sensors, various calibrated stainless steel dispensing tips were utilized to pioneer this study by dipping and retracting each tip from a small particle-laden droplet (resting on a hydrophobic n-type silicon substrate), followed by tip-sensor-contact (at a target point on the sensing area) to detach the solution (from the tip) and adsorb the particles, and ultimately determine the particles mass concentration. Upon imprinting/adsorbing the particles on the sensor, resonant frequency response measurements were made to determine the mass (or number of particles). A minimum detectable mass of ~0.05 pg was demonstrated. To further validate and compare such results, cantilever samples (containing adsorbed particles) were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the number of particles through counting (from which, the lowest count of about 11 magnetic polystyrene particles was obtained). The practicality of particle counting was essentially due to monolayer particle arrangement on the sensing surface.

Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level, instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent.

New-onset AF is associated with increased mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.

However, there are limited data on the modifiable risk factors in the general adult ICU population.We describe a protocol for a systematic review of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for new-onset AF in the general adult ICU population. The results of this review will aid the development of risk prediction tools and inform future research into AF prevention on the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database and the Cochrane Library, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched for studies that assess the association of patient variables, investigation results, interventions and diagnoses associated with subsequent new-onset AF on the ICU.Only studies involving adult patients admitted to non-service-specific ICUs will be included.

Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to “expect the unexpected” and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, “fresher” quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in ­production-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers’ “right to informed choice” explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various “­artificial” food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers’ needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), “naturalness”, respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers’ acceptance of innovative food technologies and products. Novel foods and technologies are also subject to strict regulatory pre-market safety assessment and authorisation procedures.

Although intermediate distal access catheters can go beyond the tortuous segment of internal carotid arteries, they may increase the risk of procedure-related complications, require significantly complex technical procedures, and limit the use of adjunctive techniques. Using simple neck extension alone, we successfully improved guiding catheter access in 2 patients. METHODS Through a provocative test, we confirmed suitability of manual neck extension in 2 patients with severe posterior curvature of a tortuous internal carotid artery. Intraoperatively, we manually extended the neck and stretched the curvatures. We guided a 6F guiding catheter superiorly and performed coil embolization with an occlusion balloon catheter in 1 case and with the balloon-assisted neck remodeling technique in 1 case. RESULTS Coil embolization was completed without any adverse events in both cases. CONCLUSIONS The simple neck extension technique successfully improved accessibility of the guiding catheter.

Here we report the long-term outcome of patients in this trial. METHODS We randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by centre with randomly permuted block sizes) 451 patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke related to 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to aggressive medical management (antiplatelet therapy, intensive management of vascular risk factors, and a lifestyle-modification programme) or aggressive medical management plus stenting with the Wingspan stent. The primary endpoint was any of the following: stroke or death within 30 days after enrolment, ischaemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days of enrolment, or stroke or death within 30 days after a revascularisation procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up. Primary endpoint analysis of between-group differences with log-rank test was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00576693. FINDINGS During a median follow-up of 32·4 months, 34 (15%) of 227 patients in the medical group and 52 (23%) of 224 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint event. The cumulative probability of the primary endpoints was smaller in the medical group versus the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) group (p=0·0252). Beyond 30 days, 21 (10%) of 210 patients in the medical group and 19 (10%) of 191 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint. The absolute differences in the primary endpoint rates between the two groups were 7·1% at year 1 (95% CI 0·2 to 13·8%; p=0·0428), 6·5% at year 2 (-0·5 to 13·5%; p=0·07) and 9·0% at year 3 (1·5 to 16·5%; p=0·0193). The occurrence of the following adverse events was higher in the PTAS group than in the medical group: any stroke (59 [26%] of 224 patients vs 42 [19%] of 227 patients; p=0·0468) and major haemorrhage (29 [13%]of 224 patients vs 10 [4%] of 227 patients; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION The early benefit of aggressive medical management over stenting with the Wingspan stent for high-risk patients with intracranial stenosis persists over extended follow-up. Our findings lend support to the use of aggressive medical management rather than PTAS with the Wingspan system in high-risk patients with atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis.

However, planning at a national, state, or local level to address the particular medical resource needs of children for mass critical care has yet to occur in any coordinated way. This paper presents the consensus opinion of the Task Force regarding supplies and equipment that would be required during a pediatric mass critical care crisis. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force endorsed the view that supplies and equipment must be available for a tripling of capacity above the usual peak pediatric intensive care unit capacity for at least 10 days. The recommended size-specific pediatric mass critical care equipment stockpile for two types of patients is presented in terms of equipment needs per ten mass critical care beds, which would serve 26 patients over a 10-day period. Specific recommendations are made regarding ventilator capacity, including the potential use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE(2) occurred upon TNF-α stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF-α-induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-κB. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF-α treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF-α-mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF-α-mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling.",2016-04-20,"Lin, Hsin-Ru; Wu, Yi-Hsuan; Yen, Wei-Chen; Yang, Chuen-Mao; Chiu, Daniel Tsun-Yee",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/78057e9db3bebe6ecfc99fbc036414ebd4115cfd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4838297.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097228/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153462,18036112.0,en,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd provide reduce agent nadph meet cellular need reductive biosynthesis maintenance redox homeostasis g6pd-deficient cell experience high level oxidative stress increase susceptibility viral infection cyclooxygenase-2 cox-2 key mediator regulation viral replication inflammatory response current study role g6pd inflammatory response determine scramble control g6pd-knockdown g6pd-kd a549 cell tumor necrosis factor-α tnf-α stimulation decrease expression pattern induce cox-2 reduce production downstream pge(2 occur tnf-α stimulation g6pd-kd a549 cell compare scramble control a549 cell tnf-α-induced antiviral activity reveal decrease cox-2 expression enhance susceptibility coronavirus 229e infection g6pd-kd a549 cell result decrease phosphorylation level mapk p38 erk1/2 nf-κb. impair inflammatory response g6pd-kd a549 cell find mediate nadph oxidase nox signal elucidate cell pretreatment nox2-sirna nox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride dpi addition nox activity tnf-α treatment g6pd-kd a549 cell up-regulated couple decrease nox subunit expression transcriptional level imply tnf-α-mediated nox signal require participation g6pd datum suggest g6pd deficiency affect cellular inflammatory response decrease tnf-α-mediated antiviral response g6pd-kd a549 cell result dysregulated nox/mapk/nf-κb/cox-2 signal,159

In this case, viruses propagated in the natural reservoir species cause disease in nonhuman primates that closely mimics the human disease, but passaging in cell culture attenuates these viruses to the extent that do not cause any measurable disease in nonhuman primates. As efforts to develop animal models progress, it will be important to take into account the influences that culture in vitro may have on the virulence of viruses.

This study was conducted to determine any variations in the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 status according to sex, age group, sample type, or location within the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Samples from 749 patients with suspected Middle East respiratory coronavirus who presented to Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare facilities in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were tested reflexively for influenza A/H1N1 2009 by the Ministry of Health using the RealTime ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set for real-time PCR. The sample types included nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 677), expectorated deep cough sputum (n = 32), induced sputum (n = 17), and tracheal aspirates (n = 23). RESULTS: The incidence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was higher among younger patients; 27.94% of patients in the 0–19-year age group tested positive compared to only 3.51% of patients in the ≥80-year age group. The incidence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was higher in Ras Tanura city compared to other locations in the Eastern Province. CONCLUSIONS: Younger individuals in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a relatively higher risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

82751,f6i10v6g,,Medline,Animal coronaviruses: what can they teach us about the severe acute respiratory syndrome?,,,15702725,unk,"In 2002, a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged in the People's Republic of China, associated with a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and mortality in humans. The epidemic rapidly spread throughout the world before being contained in 2003, although sporadic cases occurred thereafter in Asia. The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin from a wild animal reservoir (Himalayan palm civets [Paguma larvata] are suspected), but the definitive host is unknown. There is concern about possible transmission of SARS CoV to rodents or domestic cats (as proven experimentally) with perpetuation of the disease in these species. In livestock and poultry, CoVs are recognised causes of enteric and respiratory infections that are often fatal in young animals. Although the emergence of SARS surprised the medical community, veterinary coronavirologists had previously isolated CoVs from wildlife and documented their interspecies transmission to livestock. Furthermore, scientists were aware of compelling evidence pointing to the emergence of new CoV strains and the mutation of existing strains resulting in new disease syndromes in animals, but the evolution and disease impact of CoVs was not widely appreciated before SARS. This review focuses on the comparative pathogenesis of CoV infections, including the factors that accentuate CoV respiratory disease, with emphasis on livestock and poultry. The goal is to provide insights into CoV transmission and disease mechanisms that could potentially be applicable to SARS, highlighting the contributions of veterinary scientists to this area of study.

DESIGN AND METHODS From September 2007 through January 2008 several episodes of hPIV-3 infection were observed among young patients followed at the Oncohematology Unit (OHU) or other units of the Pediatrics Department. In 32 young patients (median age 3.5 years, range 21 days-27 years), hPIV-3 infection was diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody staining of cells from respiratory secretions, and virus quantified by real-time RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In addition, the epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing two variable regions of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene (nt 1-569 and nt 762-1239). RESULTS Of the 32 hPIV-3-positive patients, 19 were hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients, 8 had hematologic malignancies, and 5 were immunocompetent children. Sixteen patients had upper, and 16 lower respiratory tract infection. All patients but one had high viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (>1.0x10(6) RNA copies/mL). One patient died from respiratory failure with a high viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 16/32 strains were identical.

Vaccine development has traditionally focused on whole organism vaccines, either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. While successful for many different infectious diseases whole organisms are expensive to produce, require culture of the infectious agent, and have the potential to cause vaccine associated disease in hosts. With advancing technology and a desire to develop safe, cost effective vaccine candidates, the field began to focus on the development of recombinantly expressed antigens known as subunit vaccines. While more tolerable, subunit vaccines tend to be less immunogenic. Attempts have been made to increase immunogenicity with the addition adjuvants, either immunostimulatory molecules or an antigen delivery system that increases immune responses to vaccines. An area of extreme interest has been the application of nanotechnology to vaccine development, which allows for antigens to be expressed on a particulate delivery system. One of the most exciting examples of nanovaccines are rationally designed protein nanoparticles.

Beyond the anti-viral therapy: A comprehensive review,,,,unk,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related to Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. This may be in part due to an uncontrolled immune-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering a systemic hyperinflammatory response, the so-called ""cytokine storm"". The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2. While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option. However, right data on the effectiveness of different immunomodulating drugs are scarce. Herein, we discuss the pathogenesis and the possible role played by drugs such as: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL-1, calcineurin and JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, heparins, angiotensin-converting enzyme agonists and statins in severe COVID-19.",2020,"Alijotas-Reig, Jaume; Esteve-Valverde, Enrique; Belizna, Cristina; Selva-O039,; Callaghan, Albert; Pardos-Gea, Josep; Quintana, Angela; Mekinian, Arsene; Anunciacion-Llunell, Ariadna; Miró-Mur, Francesc",Autoimmun Rev,,#155065,,,,,218532702.0,en,severe acute respiratory syndrome relate coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 cause severe illness 20 patient uncontrolled immune-response sars-cov-2 infection trigger systemic hyperinflammatory response so-called cytokine storm reduction inflammatory immune-response consider potential therapeutic target severe covid-19 relationship inflammation clot activation consider furthermore mind currently specific antiviral treatment available sars-cov-2 moderate-severe form need in-hospital surveillance plus antiviral and/or hydroxychloroquine severe life-threating subset high intensity anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory therapy therapeutic option right datum effectiveness different immunomodulating drug scarce discuss pathogenesis possible role play drug antimalarials anti-il6 anti-il-1 calcineurin jak inhibitor corticosteroid immunoglobulin heparin angiotensin-converting enzyme agonist statin severe covid-19,95

In these cases, characterization of immune effector mechanisms and identification of protective epitopes/immunogens has been informative for the development of successful vaccine programs. Diseases in which the immune system does not rapidly clear the acute infection and/or convalescent immunity does not provide highly effective protection against secondary challenge pose a major hurdle for clinicians and scientists. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) falls primarily into this category, though not entirely. PRRSV causes a prolonged infection, though the host eventually clears the virus. Neutralizing antibodies can provide passive protection when present prior to challenge, though infection can be controlled in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies. In addition, primed pigs (through natural exposure or vaccination with a modified-live vaccine) show some protection against secondary challenge. While peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses have been examined, their direct contribution to antibody-mediated immunity and viral clearance have not been fully elucidated. The innate immune response following PRRSV infection, particularly the antiviral type I interferon response, is meager, but when provided exogenously, IFN-α enhances PRRSV immunity and viral control. Overall, the quality of immunity induced by natural PRRSV infection is not ideal for informing vaccine development programs. The epitopes necessary for protection may be identified through natural exposure or modified-live vaccines and subsequently applied to vaccine delivery platforms to accelerate induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Collectively, further work to identify protective B and T cell epitopes and mechanisms by which PRRSV eludes innate immunity will enhance our ability to develop more effective methods to control and eliminate PRRS disease.",2015-09-15,"Loving, Crystal L.; Osorio, Fernando A.; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Zuckermann, Federico A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f94d296b20f56f07e1a671739b223c44e36158e7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3b3b32c96347c31043a806a565d3790bdf5df946.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112826.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209116/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.07.003,42073089.0,en,highly effective vaccine produce virus virulent infection elicit strong durable protective immunity case characterization immune effector mechanism identification protective epitopes/immunogens informative development successful vaccine program diseases immune system doe rapidly clear acute infection and/or convalescent immunity doe provide highly effective protection secondary challenge pose major hurdle clinician scientist porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus prrsv fall primarily category entirely prrsv cause prolong infection host eventually clear virus neutralizing antibody provide passive protection present prior challenge infection control absence detectable neutralize antibody addition prime pig natural exposure vaccination modified-live vaccine protection secondary challenge peripheral prrsv-specific t cell response examine direct contribution antibody-mediated immunity viral clearance fully elucidate innate immune response follow prrsv infection particularly antiviral type interferon response meager provide exogenously ifn-α enhance prrsv immunity viral control overall quality immunity induce natural prrsv infection ideal inform vaccine development program epitope necessary protection identify natural exposure modified-live vaccine subsequently apply vaccine delivery platform accelerate induction protective immunity follow vaccination collectively far work identify protective b t cell epitope mechanism prrsv elude innate immunity enhance ability develop effective method control eliminate prrs disease,179

Although sustained or repeated stress can result in severe deleterious physiological effects, the causes of stress in free-ranging animals are yet poorly documented. In our study, we aimed at identifying the main factors affecting stress levels in free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) as an index of stress, after validating the method for its application in wolves. We analyzed a total of 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations, in Italy (Abruzzo), France (Mercantour), and the United States (Yellowstone). We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In social mammals sharing strong bonds among group members, the death of one or several members of the group most likely induces important stress in the remainder of the social unit. The potential impact of social and territorial stability on stress levels should be further investigated in free-ranging populations, especially in highly social and in territorial species.

Obviously, OERs have high-potential to satisfy learners in many different circumstances, as they are available in a wide range of contexts. However, the low-quality of OER metadata, in general, is one of the main reasons behind the lack of personalised services such as search and recommendation. As a result, the applicability of OERs remains limited. Nevertheless, OER metadata about covered topics (subjects) is essentially required by learners to build effective learning pathways towards their individual learning objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a work in progress project proposing an OER topic extraction approach, applying text mining techniques, to generate high-quality OER metadata about topic distribution. This is done by: 1) collecting 123 lectures from Coursera and Khan Academy in the area of data science related skills, 2) applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the collected resources in order to extract existing topics related to these skills, and 3) defining topic distributions covered by a particular OER. To evaluate our model, we used the data-set of educational resources from Youtube, and compared our topic distribution results with their manually defined target topics with the help of 3 experts in the area of data science.

It was therefore hypothesized that polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene affects the risk and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN Prospective, observational study. PATIENTS AND SETTINGS The ARDS group consisted of 101 patients treated at the medical intensive care unit; the control groups consisted of 138 ""at-risk"" patients treated at the medical intensive care unit due to acute respiratory failure but did not meet the ARDS criteria throughout the hospital course, and 210 non-at-risk subjects. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The ARDS patients and control subjects were genotyped for the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene. Association of the polymorphism and the risk and the outcome of ARDS was analyzed. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes between the ARDS, at-risk, and non-at-risk groups. The 28-day mortality rates were significantly different between the three angiotensin-converting enzyme genotypes (42%, 65%, and 75% for II, ID, and DD, respectively; p = .036). Survival analysis showed that the II genotype favorably affected 28-day survival (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.81; p = .007), whereas ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia had a negative effect (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.40; p = .008). The II genotype (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.87; p = .012) and ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.68; p = .006) were also significant prognostic factors for the in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS The angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome of ARDS.

In South Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) account for a quarter of all new HIV infections. Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) is a strategy introduced by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by 25% in the programme’s first year, and by 40% in the second year. This study will assess the change in HIV incidence and reduction in risk associated behaviours that can be attributed to the DREAMS initiative in South Africa, using a population-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data will be collected from a household-based representative sample of AGYW (between the ages 12–24 years) in four high prevalence districts (more than 10% of the population have HIV in these districts) in South Africa in which DREAMS has been implemented. A stratified cluster-based sampling approach will be used to select eligible participants for a cross-sectional survey with 18,500, to be conducted over 2017/2018. A questionnaire will be administered containing questions on sexual risk behaviour, selected academic and developmental milestones, prevalence of gender based violence, whilst examining exposure to DREAMS programmes. Biological samples, including two micro-containers of blood and self-collected vulvovaginal swab samples, are collected in each survey to test for HIV infection, HIV incidence, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. This study will measure trends in population level HIV incidence using the Limiting antigen (LAg) Avidity Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) and monitor changes in HIV incidence. DISCUSSION: Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic by 2030 requires the continual monitoring and evaluation of prevention programmes, with the aim of optimising efforts and ensuring the achievement of epidemic control. This study will determine the impact DREAMS interventions have had on HIV incidence among AGYW in a ‘real world, non-trial setting’.",2020-01-16,"George, Gavin; Cawood, Cherie; Puren, Adrian; Khanyile, David; Gerritsen, Annette; Govender, Kaymarlin; Beckett, Sean; Glenshaw, Mary; Diallo, Karidia; Ayalew, Kassahun; Gibbs, Andrew; Reddy, Tarylee; Madurai, Lorna; Kufa-Chakezha, Tendesayi; Kharsany, Ayesha B.

It is well-known that excess oxidative stress is one of the major factors causing cell damage in the liver. This study investigated the cytoprotective effects and molecular mechanism of tryptanthrin against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress in human hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells. Tryptanthrin pre-treatment blocked the reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death induced by tBHP. Moreover, tryptanthrin reversed tBHP-induced GSH reduction. This study also confirmed the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by tryptanthrin as a plausible molecular mechanism for its cytoprotective effects. Specifically, tryptanthrin treatment induced nuclear translocation and transactivation of Nrf2 as well as phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a potential upstream kinase of Nrf2. Tryptanthrin also up-regulated the expression of the heme oxygenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunits, which are representative target genes of Nrf2. Moreover, inhibitor of ERK was used to verify the important role of the ERK-Nrf2 pathway in the hepatoprotective effects of tryptanthrin.

The aim of this research is to study the phylogeny estimation from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes under the maximum parsimony criterion (MPPEP-SNP). Previous exact methods have modeled the mentioned problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Since the problem, in general, proved to be NP-hard which causes MIP models to take long runtime for solving large-scale instances, the need for non-exact methods is obvious. In this paper, the authors propose a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find the MPPEP-SNP solution in several stages by solving a specific MIP model in each stage. Created based on network flows formulation, MIP models appearing in each stage are very small; therefore, their exact solutions could be found practically very fast. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on both simulated and real instances and compared with Pars and Flow-RM as two of the best known methods.

We previously synthesized a siRNA targeting the CVB3 protease 2A (siRNA/2A) gene and achieved reduction of CVB3 replication by 92% in vitro. However, like other drugs under development, CVB3 siRNA faces a major challenge of targeted delivery. In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver CVB3 siRNAs to a specific cell population (e.g. HeLa cells containing folate receptor) using receptor ligand (folate)-linked packaging RNA (pRNA) from bacterial phage phi29. pRNA monomers can spontaneously form dimers and multimers under optimal conditions by base-pairing between their stem loops. By covalently linking a fluorescence-tag to folate, we delivered the conjugate specifically to HeLa cells without the need of transfection. We further demonstrated that pRNA covalently conjugated to siRNA/2A achieved an equivalent antiviral effect to that of the siRNA/2A alone. Finally, the drug targeted delivery was further evaluated by using pRNA monomers or dimers, which carried both the siRNA/2A and folate ligand and demonstrated that both of them strongly inhibited CVB3 replication.

PATIENT CONCERNS A 24 year-old male was referred originally by his optician at the Emergency Eye Department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary in October 2018 with visual field changes affecting the nasal field of vision in both eyes on routine eye examination. The patient reported ongoing headaches over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks associated with simultaneous peripheral visual field changes. He also reported rapid loss of weight over the same period of time. DIAGNOSIS Binasal congruous hemianopia secondary to FVL. INTERVENTIONS Full past medical and ocular history was obtained. The patient underwent full ophthalmic examination including dilated fundoscopy. Visual acuity was recorded with Snellen Chart. Color vision was assessed with Ishihara plates. Peripheral vision was assessed with both Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields. Optical coherence tomography of the macula and discs was also performed. Neuroimaging investigations included Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain. Electrophysiology investigations included Electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials. Patient was also tested for syphilis. OUTCOMES Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields confirmed the presence of complete binasal field defects. Optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, CT, MRI were all unremarkable. Ocular examination was normal. Finally, syphilis serology was negative. After 1 year of follow-up, the visual field changes have remained the same. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth case described in the literature with complete congruous binasal hemianopia due to FVL. We advocate thorough investigations with multimodal imaging of the fundus, neuroimaging and syphilis serology to exclude serious organic causes for binasal field defects prior to labeling such a field defect functional.

However, once viruses have established a particular niche for their persistence (e.g., within the CNS), the immune system has to specifically mobilize a broad range of antimicrobial effectors to contain the pathogen in the long term. Infection of the CNS with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) provides a unique model situation in which the extent of inflammatory CNS disease is determined by the balance between antiviral immune control, viral replication, and immune-mediated damage. We show here that whereas antibody- or B cell-deficient mice failed to contain MHV CNS infection and developed progressive demyelinating disease, germline IgM produced in activation-induced cytidine deaminase-deficient mice (aicda(-/-)) provided long-term protection against the chronic multiple sclerosis-like disease. Furthermore, we found that appropriate B-cell activation within the CNS-draining lymph node and subsequent CXCR3-mediated migration of antiviral IgM-secreting cells to the infected CNS was dependent on CD40-mediated interaction of B cells with T helper cells.

Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The SAVED study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (SD 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of Chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%). The telereview service was used by 32 patients in the control arm (32/35, 91%) and 18 patients in the intervention arm (18/35, 51%). Most patients in control (33/35, 94%; 95% CI 79.5%-99.0%) and intervention (34/35, 97%; 95% CI 83.4%-99.9%) arms were compliant with their final disposition. There was a low rate of re-presentation at 72 hours and 2 weeks for both control (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 2/35, 6%, 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%) and intervention (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 3/35, 9%, 95% CI 2.2%-24.2%) arms. There were no significant differences in safety (P>.99) and efficacy (P>.99) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The application of digital telereview for the follow-up of patients with abdominal pain may be safe and effective.

Interestingly, in the nineteenth century, regular and rigorous handwashing was a key (and controversial) solution proposed by the Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis to cut drastically cases of puerperal fever. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence that the case of Semmelweis and puerperal fever—a crucial historical scientific controversy—can be used as a springboard to promote university student argumentation. Our study was inspired by the fact that the Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (OECD) stressed that more efforts and resources should be invested in promoting argumentation as an essential component for scientifically literate citizens in twenty-first century societies. However, nowadays, argument and debate are virtually absent from university science education. The data was derived from 124 undergraduates’ (64 females and 60 males, 15–30 years old) written responses and audio and video recordings in a university biology course in Colombia. The findings show that the articulation of this historical controversy with decision-making, small-group debate, and whole-class debate activities can be useful for promoting undergraduates’ argumentation.

Here, we show that both Apol9 isoforms (Apol9b and Apol9a) inhibit replication of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) but not replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), or infection by a lentiviral vector. Apol9 genes are strongly expressed in mouse liver and, to a lesser extent, in pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine. Their expression is increased by type I interferon and viral infection. In contrast to genuine apolipoproteins that are involved in lipid transport, ApoL9 has an intracytoplasmic localization and does not seem to be secreted. The cytoplasmic localization of ApoL9 is in line with the observation that ApoL9 inhibits the replication step of TMEV infection. In contrast to human ApoL6, ApoL9 did not sensitize cells to apoptosis, in spite of the presence of a conserved putative BH3 domain, required for antiviral activity. ApoL9a and b isoforms interact with cellular prohibitin 1 (Phb1) and prohibitin 2 (Phb2) and this interaction might contribute to ApoL9 antiviral activity. Knocking down Phb2 slightly increased TMEV replication, irrespective of ApoL9 overexpression. The antiviral activity of prohibitins against TMEV contrasts with the pro-viral activity of prohibitins observed for VSV and reported previously for Dengue 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and influenza H5N1 viruses. ApoL9 is thus an example of ISG displaying a narrow antiviral range, which likely acts in complex with prohibitins to restrict TMEV replication.",2015-07-21,"Kreit, Marguerite; Vertommen, Didier; Gillet, Laurent; Michiels, Thomas",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/25a160364a2e056a097e4520f64c49c63140da6c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4510265.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510265/,,en,apolipoprotein l9b apol9b interferon-stimulated gene isg antiviral activity weakly express primary mouse neuron compare cell type apol9 isoform apol9b apol9a inhibit replication theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev replication vesicular stomatitis virus vsv murid herpesvirus-4 muhv-4 infection lentiviral vector apol9 gene strongly express mouse live lesser extent pancreas adipose tissue intestine expression increase type interferon viral infection contrast genuine apolipoprotein involve lipid transport apol9 intracytoplasmic localization doe secrete cytoplasmic localization apol9 line observation apol9 inhibit replication step tmev infection contrast human apol6 apol9 sensitize cell apoptosis spite presence conserve putative bh3 domain require antiviral activity apol9a b isoform interact cellular prohibitin 1 phb1 prohibitin 2 phb2 interaction contribute apol9 antiviral activity knocking phb2 slightly increase tmev replication irrespective apol9 overexpression antiviral activity prohibitins tmev contrast pro-viral activity prohibitins observe vsv report previously dengue 2 denv-2 chikungunya chikv influenza h5n1 virus apol9 example isg display narrow antiviral range likely act complex prohibitins restrict tmev replication,153

Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO2/FiO2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature. RESULTS: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.

Multiple clinical labs in the United States, Europe, and Asia have gone to considerable lengths to optimize and validate a range of protocols for agnostically detecting viral, bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic parasite nucleic acid across a range of patient specimens to aid in diagnosis for particularly recalcitrant cases. Others see a role for diagnostic metagenomics as a frontline diagnostic to replace other microbiological testing. Areas covered: There are considerable barriers to adoption for diagnostic metagenomics, including analytical sensitivity, interpretation, actionability, turnaround time, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical utility, laboratory workflow, trial comparators, cost, and reimbursement. Expert commentary: Metagenomics is unlikely to become 'one test to rule them all' any time soon, not least because it is not indicative of historical infection like some of the highest volume tests in the clinical virology lab, viral serologies. The high cost and low marginal utility compared to 'standard of care' diagnostics have forced metagenomics to be mostly used for last-ditch cases. However, waiting for such patients to declare themselves as being diagnostically challenging in turn likely lessens the diagnostic yield and actionability of the information. Significant reductions in the cost of metagenomic sequencing are required for it to move up in the diagnostic pipeline.

The genetic similarity of the isolates was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Most of the isolates from four dogs housed at a re-homing kennel were genetically similar and some isolates from different dogs were indistinguishable by both PFGE and RAPD. These isolates were cultured from dogs with non-overlapping stays in the kennel, which may indicate maintenance of some strains within kennels. A small number of isolates showed much greater genetic heterogeneity and were genetically distinct from the main group of M. cynos strains.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord injury (SCI)-associated pneumonia (SCI-AP) is associated with poor functional recovery and a major cause of death after SCI. Better tackling SCI-AP requires a common understanding on how SCI-AP is defined. This survey examines clinical algorithms relevant for diagnosis and treatment of SCI-AP. SETTING: All departments for SCI-care in Germany. METHODS: The clinical decision-making on SCI-AP and the utility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of ‘clinically defined pneumonia’ were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire including eight case vignettes of suspected SCI-AP. The diagnostic decisions based on the case information were analysed using classification and regression trees (CART). RESULTS: The majority of responding departments were aware of the CDC-criteria (88%). In the clinical vignettes, 38–81% of the departments diagnosed SCI-AP in accordance with the CDC-criteria and 7–41% diagnosed SCI-AP in deviation from the CDC-criteria. The diagnostic agreement was not associated with the availability of standard operating procedures for SCI-AP management in the departments. CART analysis identified radiological findings, fever, and worsened gas exchange as most important for the decision on SCI-AP. Frequently requested supplementary diagnostics were microbiological analyses, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin.

We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset.

Design: Cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in England from April-May 2020. Participants: The sample included 3,285 adults aged [≥]18 years. Measurements: Participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before eating, before preparing foods or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had i) attempted to quit smoking, ii) attempted to quit vaping, and iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. Findings: Odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers (20.9%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.73) and long-term (>1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, ORadj=1.33, 95%CI=1.05-1.68) than never smokers (14.5%).

Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand washing before face touching, engagement in hand washing behaviours was high (>85%) regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of past-year smokers who made a quit attempt in the past three months were triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one-in-ten current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19.

METHODS: Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. RESULTS: The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.

To avoid non specific modification of CR2 and the potential for modifying lysine residues critical to the CR2/C3d contact surface, we engineered a new protein, recombinant CR2 (rCR2), to include the C-terminal sequence VFPLECHHHHHH, a hexahistidine tag (for site-specific radiolabeling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+)). The protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. To test the function of the recombinant CR2, binding to C3d was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The function was further confirmed by binding of rCR2 to C3d(+) red blood cells (RBC) which were generated by deposition of human or rat C3d and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The affinity of rCR2 for C3d(+), in presence of 150 mM NaCl, was measured using surface plasma resonance giving rise to a K(D)≈500 nM. Radiolabeling of rCR2 or an inactive mutant of rCR2 (K41E CR2) or an unrelated protein of a similar size (C2A) with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+) at gave radiochemical yields >95%.

There are few preclinical animal models to evaluate these strategies. Here we report on a model to simultaneously evaluate both of these treatment approaches. METHODS Allogeneic clot was injected through the 6 F guide catheter after creating >50% luminal stenosis of the common carotid arteries of New Zealand White rabbits. The stenosis was released after 1 h, allowing sufficient time for clot-vessel wall interaction. Occlusion was confirmed and each vessel was assigned to receive either balloon angioplasty alone, intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase, Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA), tPA delivery through prototype balloon infusion wire (NIT Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), partial stent deployment or partial stent deployment with locally delivered tPA. The negative control received no treatment. RESULTS In vivo revascularization Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score revealed that the balloon infusion wire achieved a stable and higher revascularization score of TICI 2B, with a lower dose of tPA in comparison with other treatment strategies.

Yet, there is little evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants to treat depression with concomitant frailty. To better understand this issue, we examined the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression and then considered implications for frailty. METHODS Due to the absence of therapeutic studies of frail older adults with depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized controlled trials that compared antidepressants versus placebo for adults with depression, age 65 years or older. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, reference lists from meta-analyses/studies, hand searches of publication lists, and related articles on PubMed. Outcomes included rates of response, remission, and adverse events. After evaluating the data, we applied a frailty-informed framework to consider how the evidence could be applied to frailty. RESULTS Nine trials were included in the meta-analysis (n = 2704). Subjects had moderate to severe depression. For older adults with depression, there was no statistically significant difference in response or remission to second-generation antidepressants compared to placebo. Response occurred in 45.3% of subjects receiving an antidepressant compared to 40.5% receiving placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37, p = 0.12, I2 = 71%). Remission occurred in 33.1% with antidepressant versus 31.3% with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.31, p = 0.30, I2 = 56%) (Figure 2 and 3). There were more withdrawals due to adverse events with antidepressants, 13% versus 5.8% (RR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.45-3.63; p < 0.001; I2 = 61%; NNH 14, 95% CI:10-28). IMPLICATIONS FOR FRAILTY Subjects in the meta-analysis did not have obvious characteristics of frailty. Using framework questions to consider the implications of frailty, we hypothesize that, like older adults, frail individuals with depression may not respond to antidepressants. Further, observational studies suggest that those who are frail may be less responsive to antidepressants compared to the non-frail. Given the vulnerability of frailty, adverse events may be more burdensome. CONCLUSIONS Second-generation antidepressants have uncertain benefit for older adults with depression and cause more adverse events compared to placebo.

Healthcare systems around the world are trying to simultaneously treat patients with COVID-19 infection, prepare for its long-term impacts, and manage patients with other acute and chronic diseases. There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes. Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities. The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges. We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19.

Transfection and transgenic studies have identified the open reading frame (ORF) present in the 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR) as encoding superantigen function. In this study, we have used an in vitro translation system in an attempt to characterize the molecular nature of the protein encoded by the 3′ ORF of Mtv‐8. Using various constructs encoding full‐length and truncated versions of the ORF product, we report that the hydrophobic region close to the amino terminus of the 36‐kDa protein can function as a transmembrane domain. Protease digestion experiments also demonstrate that the protein has a type‐II transmembrane conformation with an extra‐cytoplasmic carboxy terminus. Since this hydrophobic region is conserved between all known MMTV, we speculate that LTR ORF, including those proposed to encode the minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigens, are also capable of encoding type‐II transmembrane glycoproteins. The polymorphism between MMTV LTR ORF products, which correlates with deletion phenotypes, is predominantly in the carboxy‐terminal extracellular region, consistent with a major role in interaction with the T cell receptor.",2005-11-17,"Knight, Andrew M.; Harrison, Georgina B.; Pease, Richard J.; Robinson, Peter J.; Julian Dyson, P.",Eur J Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/821a702c78c8084247ef6206b3c2fb2c45a24fa7.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163594/,,en,recent report exogenous endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv encode superantigens transfection transgenic study identify open read frame orf present 3′ long terminal repeat ltr encode superantigen function study use vitro translation system attempt characterize molecular nature protein encode 3′ orf mtv‐8 construct encode full‐length truncate version orf product report hydrophobic region close amino terminus 36‐kda protein function transmembrane domain protease digestion experiment demonstrate protein type‐ii transmembrane conformation extra‐cytoplasmic carboxy terminus hydrophobic region conserve know mmtv speculate ltr orf include propose encode minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigen capable encode type‐ii transmembrane glycoprotein polymorphism mmtv ltr orf product correlate deletion phenotype predominantly carboxy‐terminal extracellular region consistent major role interaction t cell receptor,110

This study adapted Respondent Driven Sampling, a peer-driven recruitment method, to a digital platform (d-RDS) and evaluated its utility to recruit community-dwelling emerging adult (EA) risky drinkers, who are under-served and more difficult to reach for assessment and intervention than their college student peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Community-dwelling EA risky drinkers (N = 357) were recruited using d-RDS (M age = 23.6 years, 64.0% women). Peers recruited peers in an iterative fashion. Participants completed a web-based cross-sectional survey of drinking practices and problems and associated risk and protective factors. RESULTS: d-RDS successfully recruited EA risky drinkers. On average, the sample reported recent drinking exceeding low-risk drinking guidelines and 8.80 negative consequences in the past three months. Compared to age-matched respondents from the representative U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the sample reported more past month drinking days and more drinks consumed per drinking day (ps < .001). At higher consumption levels, predicted positive associations were found with lower education and receipt of public assistance.

60718,4a2n0ybq,,Medline,The wisdom of crowds in action: Forecasting epidemic diseases with a web-based prediction market system.,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.04.014,,27318069,unk,"BACKGROUND The quest for an effective system capable of monitoring and predicting the trends of epidemic diseases is a critical issue for communities worldwide. With the prevalence of Internet access, more and more researchers today are using data from both search engines and social media to improve the prediction accuracy. In particular, a prediction market system (PMS) exploits the wisdom of crowds on the Internet to effectively accomplish relatively high accuracy. OBJECTIVE This study presents the architecture of a PMS and demonstrates the matching mechanism of logarithmic market scoring rules. The system was implemented to predict infectious diseases in Taiwan with the wisdom of crowds in order to improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasting. METHODS The PMS architecture contains three design components: database clusters, market engine, and Web applications. The system accumulated knowledge from 126 health professionals for 31 weeks to predict five disease indicators: the confirmed cases of dengue fever, the confirmed cases of severe and complicated influenza, the rate of enterovirus infections, the rate of influenza-like illnesses, and the confirmed cases of severe and complicated enterovirus infection. RESULTS Based on the winning ratio, the PMS predicts the trends of three out of five disease indicators more accurately than does the existing system that uses the five-year average values of historical data for the same weeks. In addition, the PMS with the matching mechanism of logarithmic market scoring rules is easy to understand for health professionals and applicable to predict all the five disease indicators. CONCLUSIONS The PMS architecture of this study affords organizations and individuals to implement it for various purposes in our society. The system can continuously update the data and improve prediction accuracy in monitoring and forecasting the trends of epidemic diseases.

Natural compounds with antioxidant activity may provide a preventive measure against infection. Tea polyphenols were evaluated for their ability to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication in Vero cell culture. Among the polyphenolic compounds tested, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) potently inhibited replication of EV71. EGCG and GCG reduced the titer of infectious progeny virus by 95%. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also revealed that EGCG suppressed replication of genomic RNA. It was accompanied by an increased cytoprotective effect. EGCG and GCG caused 5-fold increase in the viability of EV71-infected cells. The viral inhibitory effect correlated well with the antioxidant capacity of polyphenol. Mechanistically, EV71 infection led to increased oxidative stress, as shown by increased dichlorofluorescein and MitoSOX Red fluorescence. Upon EGCG treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was significantly reduced. Consistent with this, EV71 replication was enhanced in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient cells, and such enhancement was largely reversed by EGCG.

Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves.

Immunosuppression rendered 15 day old mice more susceptible to infection but adult mice remained insusceptible. The transfer of immune or non immune spleen cells from resistant mice did not confer resistance to newborn mice. Treatment of resistant mice with anti interferon globulin (AIG) did not render them more susceptible. These results indicate that the immune response is partially responsible for the development of resistance to OC43 infection but that it is only partially protective and other factors must also be required.

Recurrence and seroma formation may be difficult to distinguish. Many adjunctive techniques with which to reduce the incidence of seroma formation after laparoscopic inguinal repair have been described in the literature; however, the evidence for using intraoperative adjunctive techniques is limited. Therefore, the present systematic review was performed to evaluate the effects and limitations of adjunctive techniques used during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Major databases (PubMed, Embase, Springer, and Cochrane Library) were searched using the terms ""seroma,"" ""laparoscopic inguinal hernia"", ""TAPP"", ""TEP"", ""inguinal hernia"", ""tack"", ""barbed suture"", ""drainage"", ""Endoloop technique"", and ""fibrin sealant"". All studies involving adults undergoing laparoscopic/endoscopic inguinal hernioplasty with at least one intervention designed to reduce seroma formation were included. RESULTS Of the 965 studies identified, 8 met the inclusion criteria. Six adjunctive techniques were described in the literature. Transversalis fascia (TF) inversion with tacking: one prospective non-randomized controlled study revealed a lower incidence of postoperative seroma after TF inversion with tacking for direct inguinal hernias (4.17% vs. 14.29%, P < 0.05). Endoloop technique: one prospective study of 76 cases involving this technique revealed a low incidence of seroma formation (3.9% at 2 weeks) in direct hernias. Barbed suture closure of TF: one prospective study of 36 direct hernias reported only one clinical palpable seroma that resolved 1 month later. Surgical drains: three trials reported the results of drains, and the pooling results demonstrated significantly less seroma formation in patients with surgical drains (2.1 vs. 23.8%; odds ratio 0.12; 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.19; P < 0.0001). Fibrin sealant: one prospective clinical study of 40 patients with indirect inguinal hernias reported a lower volume (P < 0.001) and lower incidence (5% vs. 15%) of seroma formation in the fibrin group. Distal sac fixation technique: in one prospective study of six patients with large inguinoscrotal hernias, one patient developed a seroma on postoperative day 8. CONCLUSION Seroma formation is a natural process that cannot be completely prevented following laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty, especially in patients with direct and large indirect inguinal hernias. Some intraoperative adjunctive techniques are effective in reducing clinically palpable seroma formation in select patients.

Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the bowel injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local inflammatory reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C4. Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous probiotics such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check.

Here, we analyzed the effects of the plant compound silvestrol, a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. We found that silvestrol is also a potent inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. EC(50) values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM silvestrol were determined for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. For the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Silvestrol strongly inhibits the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. Furthermore, potential antiviral effects against human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus type 1 (PV), representing different species in the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), were investigated. The two viruses employ an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation mechanism. For PV, which is known to require the activity of eIF4A, an EC(50) value of 20 nM silvestrol was determined in MRC-5 cells. The higher EC(50) value of 100 nM measured for HRV A1 indicates a less critical role of eIF4A activity in HRV A1 IRES-mediated translation initiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of preoperative Onyx embolization procedures for treatment of head, neck, and spine tumors from 2009 to 2011. Patient demographics and information relating to the embolization procedure and operation were recorded. Measures of Onyx efficacy included intraoperative blood loss and length of surgery. Angiographic and histologic penetration, in addition to percentage of tumor devascularization, were assessed as predictors of efficacy. RESULTS A total of 22 patients with 17 head or neck and 5 spinal lesions underwent trans-arterial preoperative Onyx embolization. Good angiographic penetration was reported in 41% of tumors and central histologic penetration in 59%, with mean tumor devascularization of 85.3% (standard deviation [SD]: 12.6%). There was no relationship between angiographic and histologic Onyx penetrance. Mean surgical blood loss was 1342 mL (SD: 1327 mL), and length of surgery was 289 minutes (SD: 162 minutes). Neither angiographic, nor histologic Onyx penetration predicted intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.38 and p = 0.32, respectively) or surgical length (p = 0.62 and 0.90, respectively). Devascularization was not associated with blood loss (p = 0.62), but it was a negative predictor of surgical length (p = 0.013).

Most emerging infections result in dead-end ""spillover"" events in which a pathogen is transmitted from an animal reservoir to a human but is unable to achieve the sustained human-to-human transmission necessary for a full-blown epidemic. It is therefore critical to determine why only some virus infections are efficiently transmitted among humans whereas others are not. We sought to determine which biological features best characterized those viruses that have achieved sustained human transmission. Accordingly, we compiled a database of 203 RNA and DNA human viruses and used an information theoretic approach to assess which of a set of key biological variables were the best predictors of human-to-human transmission. The variables analyzed were as follows: taxonomic classification; genome length, type, and segmentation; the presence or absence of an outer envelope; recombination frequency; duration of infection; host mortality; and whether or not a virus exhibits vector-borne transmission. This comparative analysis revealed multiple strong associations. In particular, we determined that viruses with low host mortality, that establish long-term chronic infections, and that are nonsegmented, nonenveloped, and, most importantly, not transmitted by vectors were more likely to be transmissible among humans.

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human. Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.",2020-06-30,"Zuo, Mingzhang; Huang, Yuguang; Ma, Wuhua; Xue, Zhanggang; Zhang, Jiaqiang; Gong, Yahong; Che, Lu",Chinese Medical Sciences Journal,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/30dde41d5957c36f739282c913588fcd195d311c.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001929420300274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001929420300274; https://doi.org/10.24920/003724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102726/,211536132.0,en,coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cause novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 highly contagious disease firstly appear wuhan hubei province china december 2019 month rapidly china infect patient mild symptom include fever fatigue cough severe case patient progress rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulopathy new coronavirus report spread droplet contact natural aerosol human human aerosol-producing procedure endotracheal intubation anesthesiologist high risk nosocomial infection fact sars-cov-2 infection anesthesiologist endotracheal intubation confirm covid-19 patient report hospital wuhan expert panel airway management chinese society anaesthesiology deliberate draft recommendation hope guide performance endotracheal intubation frontline anesthesiologist critical care physician airway management enhance droplet/airborne personal protective equitment ppe apply health care provider good airway assessment airway intervention vital importance patient normal airway awake intubation avoid modify rapid sequence induction strongly recommend sufficient muscle relaxant assure intubation patient difficult airway good preparation airway device detail intubation plan,142

In the present study, we investigated the whole genomic sequence of a SARS-like bat CoV (16BO133) and found it to be 29,075 nt in length with a 40.9% G+C content. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of the ORF 1ab and the spike gene showed that the bat coronavirus strain 16BO133 was grouped with the Beta-CoV lineage B and was closely related to the JTMC15 strain isolated from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in China. However, 16BO133 was distinctly located in the phylogenetic topology of the human SARS CoV strain (Tor2). Interestingly, 16BO133 showed complete elimination of ORF8 regions induced by a frame shift of the stop codon in ORF7b. The lowest amino acid identity of 16BO133 was identified at the spike region among various ORFs. The spike region of 16BO133 showed 84.7% and 75.2% amino acid identity with Rf1 (SARS-like bat CoV) and Tor2 (human SARS CoV), respectively. In addition, the S gene of 16BO133 was found to contain the amino acid substitution of two critical residues (N479S and T487 V) associated with human infection. In conclusion, we firstly carried out whole genome characterization of the SARS-like bat coronavirus discovered in the Republic of Korea; however, it presumably has no human infectivity. However, continuous surveillance and genomic characterization of coronaviruses from bats are necessary due to potential risks of human infection induced by genetic mutation.

The results revealed that mice which received NSC transplantation and optogenetic inhibition had smaller brain infarct volume and increased NSC migration compared to the NSC alone or PBS group (p < 0.05). In contrast, mice which received NSC transplantation and optogenetic excitation showed no difference in infarct volume and neurological behavior improvement compared to the PBS control group.

Results We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p = 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2.

Among them, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) have been both successfully performed in recent years. In this study, we compared the treatment results of patients who underwent LGP, a method that was introduced later consisting of plication of gastric greater curvature to achieve volume reduction, with results of patients who underwent LSG. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data on morbid obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery with either LSG or LPG in Konya Beyhekim Hospital between 2009 and 2012. Demographic features including age and sex, preoperative blood biochemistry, body mass index (BMI) before and after operation, duration of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality and complications were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-five patients who were operated for obesity between 2009 and 2012 were included in the study. 29 patients underwent LGP, and 26 patients LSG. The BMI in the LGP and LSG groups was 41.4±3 kg/m(2) and 42.0±3.1 kg/m(2), respectively. There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of BMI. Two groups were also similar in terms of age and gender. In the LGP group, one patient had postoperative necrosis of the suture line. One patient in the LSG group was re-operated due to bleeding. Another patient in this group had leakage at the suture line. Postoperative BMI assessment of groups revealed significantly lower BMI levels in the LSG group. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the LGP group. There was no significant difference in complication rates between two groups. CONCLUSION In this study, we obtained similar results in patients who were treated with LGP or LSG. Moreover, LSG was more efficient in decreasing BMI in morbid obesity surgery when compared to LGP. However, duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in LGP group.

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationships between physicians' and other providers' primary specialties and their opioid prescribing practices among patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). METHODS Prescriptions for opioids filled by 81,459 Medicaid patients with CNCP in North Carolina (USA), 18 to 64 years of age, enrolled at any point during a one-year study period were examined. χ2<⁄span> statistics were used to examine bivariate differences in prescribing practices according to specialty. For multivariable analyses, maximum-likelihood logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of specialty on prescribing practices, controlling for patients' pain diagnoses and demographic characteristics. RESULTS Of prescriptions filled by patients with CNCP, who constituted 6.4% of the total sample of 1.28 million individuals, 12.0% were for opioids. General practitioner⁄family medicine specialists and internists were least likely to prescribe opioids, and orthopedists were most likely. Across specialties, men were more likely to receive opioids than women, as were white individuals relative to other races⁄ethnicities. In multivariate analyses, all specialties except internal medicine had higher odds of prescribing an opioid than general practitioners: orthopedists, OR 7.1 (95% CI 6.7 to 7.5); dentists, OR 3.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 3.6); and emergency medicine physicians, OR 2.7 (95% CI 2.6 to 2.8).

The clinical significance of FGL2 was investigated using tissue microarray analysis of samples from 82 patients with CRC. The molecular effects of FGL2 in CRC cells were determined using RNA interference and ectopic expression of FGL2. The overexpression of FGL2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients, and it was determined to be an independent predictor of overall survival (P < 0.05). The depletion of FGL2 expression inhibited tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo, while ectopic overexpression of FGL2 enhanced cell invasion and induced EMT in vitro.

Among RNA templates, hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents an excellent example to challenge the potential of LRP technology due to its extensive secondary structures and its difficulty to be readily cultured in vitro. The only source for viral genome amplification is clinical samples in which HCV is usually present at low titers. We have created a comprehensive optimization protocol that allows robust amplification of a 9.1kb fragment of HCV, followed by efficient cloning into a novel vector. Detailed analyses indicate the lack of potential LRP-mediated recombination and the preservation of viral diversity.

Respiratory virus infection is considered as one of the important causes of COPD exacerbations. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of respiratory virus infection in COPD exacerbations and to find the factors associated with susceptibility to viral infections. Furthermore, we tried to examine if COPD exacerbations caused by viral infections have more severe clinical outcomes in comparison with those with non-viral causes. We enrolled the patients with acute exacerbations of COPD who were hospitalized in a university hospital, over a 2-year period. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and viruses were identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. A total of 278 episodes of COPD exacerbations were recorded in 213 patients with COPD (number of females = 73). Among the COPD exacerbations, viral infection was detected in 78 episodes (28.1%) from 67 subjects. The most common virus was rhinovirus (38.8%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza A, parainfluenza, adenovirus and metapneumovirus. In multivariate regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, BMI, lung function and history of exacerbations, female subjects were found to be significantly associated with viral infections in COPD exacerbations (Odds ratio 2.58, 95%CI 1.25-5.31, P = 0.010).

We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study, and followed-up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with real-time reverse transcription PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families were compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal-viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan-Meier plot. By 29 February 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%).

In Mexico, an outbreak at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases was reported (24 cases). The results of epidemiological surveillance of Enterovirus sp. (EV) and other respiratory viruses in a national pediatric tertiary care level hospital are presented. Methods Following the alert issued by the reemergence of EV-D68 in 2014, epidemiological surveillance -which only detected respiratory viruses by PCR in patients with influenza-like illness using nasopharyngeal swabs- expanded to include children with asthma exacerbation or acute respiratory distress. Positive samples to EV were confirmed and typed by sequencing. Subsequent sequencing was used to obtain the complete viral genome. Results Of 1705 samples, 13 were positive to EV. Patients with EV presented the following comorbidities: chronic lung disease (7.7%), neoplastic disease (15.4%), allergic asthma/rhinitis (23%), recurrent pneumonia (23%), and other (23%). Of the 13 samples positive for EV, three were positive for EV-D68. These cases required invasive mechanical ventilation, presented no neurological involvement and survived. Conclusions The impact of the population studied by EV-D68 was lower than that reported in Mexico during the same period.

The broad-spectrum inhibitors cathepsin inhibitor III and E-64d gave comparable dose-dependent inhibition of Moloney MLV Env and VSV G pseudotypes, suggesting that the decrease did not involve the envelope protein. Whereas, CA-074 Me gave a biphasic response that differentiated between Moloney MLV Env and VSV G at low concentrations, at which the drug is highly selective for cathepsin B, but was similar for both glycoproteins at higher concentrations, at which CA-074 Me inhibits other cathepsins. Moloney MLV infection was lower on cathepsin B knockout fibroblasts than wild-type cells, whereas VSV G infection was not reduced on the B-/- cells. Taken together, these results support the notion that cathepsin B acts at an envelope-dependent step while another cathepsin acts at an envelope-independent step, such as uncoating or viral-DNA synthesis. Virus binding was not affected by CA-074 Me, whereas syncytium induction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with cathepsin B involvement in membrane fusion. Western blot analysis revealed specific cathepsin B cleavage of SU in vitro, while TM and CA remained intact. Infection could be enhanced by preincubation of Moloney MLV with cathepsin B, consistent with SU cleavage potentiating infection.

METHODS: In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. RESULTS: Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020.

Because of the impact of SARS on the Radiology Department, the department established a SARS emergency infection control team and re-designed the department's infection-control and emergency-management procedures based on the concept of risk-grade protection. This effort included installing a radiographic room at the fever-screening station, re-allocating human resources in the Radiology Department, training the department staff in infection control, and drafting new operational procedures for radiographers conducting X-ray examinations on SARS patients. The goal of this program was to reduce the infection rate and distribute materials efficiently in the department.

Available published data, unpublished data, and recent collections (1997-2000) were compared and reviewed. Data were stratified by geography to compare the declining western Alaskan population in the Aleutian Islands through eastern Prince William Sound to the increasing population in southeastern Alaska. Prevalences of antibodies from the 1970s to the early 1990s were noted for Leptospira interrogans, Chlamydophila psittaci, Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1, and calciviruses. Serum samples collected from 1997-2000 were tested for antibodies to these agents as well as to marine mammal morbilliviruses, canine parvovirus, and canine adenovirus-1 and -2. Conclusions could not be drawn about changes in antibody prevalence to these agents during the decline of Steller sea lions, however, because data were incomplete or not comparable as a result of inconsistencies in testing techniques. Despite these shortcomings, results provided no convincing evidence of significant exposure of Steller sea lions to morbilliviruses, Brucella spp., canine parvovirus, or L. interrogans. Steller sea lions have been exposed to phocid herpesviruses, caliciviruses, canine adenovirus, and C. psittaci or to cross-reactive organisms in regions of both increasing and decreasing sea lion abundance. Based on similar antibody prevalence estimates from the increasing and decreasing populations, these agents are unlikely to have been the primary cause of the population decline. They may have contributed to the decline or impeded population recovery, however, because of undetected mortality and morbidity or reductions of fecundity and body condition in animals under other stresses.

AIM: We aimed to present metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) as a potential tool to detect pathogens. METHODS: In the recent year, mNGS is shown the potential to detect pathogens without the need of hypothesis guided approach and is proven to be highly effective. RESULTS: A recent prospective study in the United States compared the diagnostic performance of routine diagnostic tests with mNGS and showed that mNGS detected a bacteria or virus in the CSF of 13 of 58 patients presenting with meningoencephalitis who were negative for or not assessed with routine diagnostic test including PCR. NGS also has the advantage to cover entire viral genomes.

Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process. However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons.

METHODS Seventy-one patients with 87 HCC lesions (mean +/- SD; 19.5 +/- 9.6 mm) underwent CEUS using Sonazoid and dynamic CT after radiofrequency ablation (n = 55), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 22), or radiofrequency ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 10). Two hepatologists (observer 1; 10 years of experience, and 2; 20 years of experience) reviewed the CEUS and dynamic CT images independently and evaluated presence or absence of the local recurrence. Diagnostic performance for the local recurrence was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS The Az value for dynamic CT was significantly lower in observer 1 than 2 (p < 0.05). The sensitivity of CEUS was 79% in observer 1 and 83.9% in observer 2, and that of dynamic CT was 83.9% and 90.3%, respectively. The specificity of CEUS was 96%, and that of dynamic CT was 92%, in both observers.

Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) might allow for local treatment of these complications, thereby saving patients from otherwise major surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients undergoing TES in the IJsselland Hospital (NL) since 1996 were recorded in a prospective database, of which twenty patients were treated for complications after previous rectal surgery. Data on prior treatment, surgical techniques, outcomes, and need for additional surgery were collected. RESULTS Twenty patients were identified from the database (rectourinary fistula n = 3, rectovaginal fistula n = 5, anastomotic stricture n = 8, and rectal stenosis n = 4). One of the three (33 %) rectourinary fistulas and two of five (40 %) rectovaginal fistulas were successfully treated with TES. Anastomotic strictures were successfully treated in 5/8 (63 %) patients. Strictures after local excision of rectal tumors were successfully treated in 3/4 (75 %) patients. No minor complication and one major complication occurred (rectovaginal fistula after stenoplasty eventually requiring Hartmann's procedure).

119466,dtnc7x6a,,WHO,"Elective, Non-urgent Procedures and Aesthetic Surgery in the Wake of SARS-COVID-19: Considerations Regarding Safety, Feasibility and Impact on Clinical Management",,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a near total stop of non-urgent, elective surgeries across all specialties in most affected countries. In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed.

Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains.

The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation- competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the connexins. Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the connexins contain a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo in association with their membrane insertion. Consequently, a specific factor or condition must be required to prevent this aberrant processing of connexins under normal conditions in the cell.",1994-10-02,,J Cell Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8acd6f32fca98b572ad9c5cce743dd21d26b115e.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120216/,,en,connexins protein form gap junction channel polytopic plasma membrane pm protein traverse plasma membrane bilayer time insertion different connexins membrane er study synthesize connexins translation- competent cell lysates supplement pancreatic er-derived microsomes express connexins vivo eucaryotic cell type addition subcellular distribution connexins determine vitro-synthesis presence microsomes result signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion connexins membrane insertion connexins accompany efficient proteolytic process dependent microsome concentration endogenous unprocessed connexins detectable microsomes use indicate pancreatic microsomes serve competent recipient vivo unprocessed length connexins orient amino terminus cytoplasm analysis cleavage reaction indicate unprecedented process signal peptidase result removal amino-terminal portion connexins variable similar connexin cleavage product identify er membrane connexin overexpress cell generate correlate level protein expression result demonstrate connexins contain cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site process enzyme vitro vivo association membrane insertion consequently specific factor condition require prevent aberrant process connexins normal condition cell,140

In parallel, the beneficial effect of a high omega-3 PUFA diet on infarct size can be attenuated by increased omega-6 PUFA consumption. The present study was designed to determine if augmented linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 PUFA administered at the same time, attenuates the cardioprotective action of RvD1. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.1μg RvD1 alone or with one of three LA doses (1, 5 or 10μg) directly into the left ventricle chamber 5min before ischemia. The animals underwent 40min of ischemia by occlusion of the left descending coronary artery followed by 30min or 24h of reperfusion. Infarct size and neutrophil accumulation were evaluated after 24h of reperfusion, while caspase-3, -8 and -9 and Akt activities were assessed at 30min of reperfusion. LA attenuated cardioprotection afforded by RvD1, resulting in significantly increased infarct size. Neutrophil accumulation and Akt activity were similar between groups. Caspase activities, especially caspase-9, which could be activated by ischemia, were stimulated in the presence of LA, suggesting that this omega-6 PUFA accentuates ischemia intensity.

89674,yta9eqab,,Medline,The cellular and molecular pathogenesis of coronaviruses.,,,8384676,unk,"Coronaviruses cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and animals but generally fall into two classes, with respiratory or enteric tropisms. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rat coronaviruses are the viruses most frequently encountered in the laboratory animal setting. This review focuses primarily on the cellular and molecular aspects of MHV pathogenesis. The high mutation and recombination rates of coronaviruses lead to a diverse, ever-changing population of MHV strains. The spike (S) protein is the most variable coronavirus protein and is responsible for binding to cell surface receptors, inducing cell fusion and humoral and cellular immunity. Differences within the S protein of different MHV strains have been linked to their variable tropisms. Since immunity to MHV is strain-specific, seropositive mice can be reinfected with different strains of MHV. Natural infections with MHV are acute, with persistence occurring at the population level, not within an individual mouse, unless it is immunocompromised. Age, genotype, immunologic status of the mouse, and MHV strain influence the type and severity of disease caused by MHV. Interference with research by MHV has been reported primarily in the fields of immunology and tumor biology and may be a reflection of MHV's capacity to grow in several types of immune cells. While many methods are available to diagnose coronavirus infection, serologic tests, primarily ELISA and IFA, are the most commonly used. MHV is best managed on a preventive basis.

The online landscape and patterns of information consumption, however, have notably changed over the past decade necessitating an updated examination of health-related internet use (HRIU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Using survey data from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) iterations, the objectives of this study were to report prevalence, trends, and user profiles in HRIU in terms of emailing doctors, buying medicine online, and support group participation. Descriptive analyses and weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Cancer survivors who reported not using the internet were more likely to be older, belong to ethnic minorities, be less educated, and reside in rural areas as compared with those who reported using the internet. Except for participation in online support groups, all other types of HRIU increased in prevalence across the years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the increased penetration of the internet and the altered online health communication landscape, we found increased prevalence of HRIU among cancer survivors. However, the digital divide persists in terms of internet access. These findings can inform initiatives to bridge the gap among survivors of varying profiles in using the internet for their health needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is increased reliance on online platforms to obtain and communicate health-related information. The risk with this approach is potential oversight of ensuring equity in terms of internet access and technology literacy among survivors.

With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.",2011-10-20,"Zamzami, Mazin A; Price, Gareth R; Taylor, Robert W; Blakely, Emma L; Oancea, Iulia; Bowling, Francis; Duley, John A",BMC Res Notes,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3208482.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22011414/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-426,12237675.0,en,background developments dna resequencing microarray include mitochondrial dna mtdna sequence mutation detection failure microarray identify base compare reference sequence designate n-call study re-examine n-call distribution mtdna sample sequence affymetrix mitochip v.2.0 base hypothesis n-calls represent insertion deletion indels mtdna findings analyse 16 patient mtdna sample use mitochip n-calls proprietary gseq software significantly reduce freeware on-line algorithm resqmi sprofiler utilize sprofiler decrease n-calls effect homoplasmic heteroplasmic mutation level compare gseq software resqmi produce significant change mutation load good produce long n-cell stretch reason far analysis use resqmi attempt conventional dna sequence long n-calls stretch sprofiler reveal 7 insertion 12 point mutation analysis single-base n-calls mtdna sample find 3 point mutation conclusions study ﻿1 analyse n-calls produce gseq software mitochipv2.0 narrow focus long stretch n-calls reveal sprofiler conventional sequence able identify unique insertion point mutation shorter n-calls harbour point mutation absence deletion n-calls suggest probe confirmation affect bind n-calling study support contention gseq capable assign basis use conjunction sprofiler,157

It affects every country without considering country's race, nationality and economic status. This paper aims at analysing primarily the current situations of Bangladesh and predicting infections and deaths for moderated term intervals by a proposed projection technique called Infection Trajectory-Pathway Strategy (ITPS) and for short term intervals prediction for total infections, deaths along with total number of severe patients and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients by polynomial regression modeling approach. Since April 7, Bangladesh has started to face critical situations as the number of infections has accelerated very fast in the following days. However, the fatality rate decreases considerably from 15.7 on April 1 to 4.9 on April 14, which is still high among the south asian countries. Of the 1012 cases reported on April 14, almost 70\% are the male, 42\% are from the capital Dhaka. We have found that the potential pathway of infections for Bangldesh would be the similar pathways that are experienced by Austria, Netherlands, Israel, France and United Kingdom. These countries are ahead a number of weeks and days in terms of infection cases since their 100-th confirmed cases. Our proposed projection method ITPS suggests that by May 10, Bangladesh will cross 12000 incidences and 720 deaths which, by May 16 will be 27000 and 1644 respectively. On the other hand, the regression model suggests that by the end of April, total number of infections, deaths, severe patients and ICU patients will be 5780, 347, 775, and 694 respectively.

This study prospectively assessed efficacy and safety of linezolid, compared with a dose-optimized vancomycin regimen, for treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, controlled, multicenter trial involving hospitalized adult patients with hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated MRSA pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 7-14 days. Vancomycin dose was adjusted on the basis of trough levels. The primary end point was clinical outcome at end of study (EOS) in evaluable per-protocol (PP) patients. Prespecified secondary end points included response in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population at end of treatment (EOT) and EOS and microbiologic response in the PP and mITT populations at EOT and EOS. Survival and safety were also evaluated. RESULTS Of 1184 patients treated, 448 (linezolid, n = 224; vancomycin, n = 224) were included in the mITT and 348 (linezolid, n = 172; vancomycin, n = 176) in the PP population. In the PP population, 95 (57.6%) of 165 linezolid-treated patients and 81 (46.6%) of 174 vancomycin-treated patients achieved clinical success at EOS (95% confidence interval for difference, 0.5%-21.6%; P = .042). All-cause 60-day mortality was similar (linezolid, 15.7%; vancomycin, 17.0%), as was incidence of adverse events. Nephrotoxicity occurred more frequently with vancomycin (18.2%; linezolid, 8.4%).

METHODS Ninety-eight patients with 126 HCCs designated to undergo thermal ablation treatment were enrolled in this prospective study. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion was performed intraoperatively to evaluate whether 5-mm AM was covered by the ablative area. If possible, supplementary ablation was applied at the site of inadequate AM. The CEUS image quality, the time used for CEUS-CT/MR image fusion and the success rate of image fusion were recorded. Local tumor progression (LTP) was observed during follow-up. Clinical factors including AM were examined to identify risk factors for LTP. RESULTS The success rate of image fusion was 96.2% (126/131), and the duration required for image fusion was 4.9 ± 2.0 (3-13) min. The CEUS image quality was good in 36.1% (53/147) and medium in 63.9% (94/147) of the cases. By supplementary ablation, 21.8% (12/55) of lesions with inadequate AMs became adequate AMs. During follow-up, there were 5 LTPs in lesions with inadequate AMs and 1 LTP in lesions with adequate AMs. Multivariate analysis showed that AM was the only independent risk factor for LTP (hazard ratio, 9.167; 95% confidence interval, 1.070-78.571; p = 0.043).

Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5′ direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.",1988-11-04,"Jacks, Tyler; Madhani, Hiten D.; Masiarz, Frank R.; Varmus, Harold E.",Cell,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/618af94e679636181030cd0fa230d5e0224ff0b9.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867488900311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2846182/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867488900311,25672863.0,en,gag-pol protein rous sarcoma virus rsv precursor enzyme responsible reverse transcription integration express gene lie different translational read frame ribosomal frameshifting localize site frameshifting frameshifting reaction mediate slippage adjacent trnas single nucleotide 5′ direction gag terminator immediately follow frameshift site require frameshifting suspect retroviral frameshift site mediate frameshifting place end rsv gag mutations rsv pol affect synthesis gag-pol protein vitro effect mutation correlate potential form rna stem-loop structure adjacent frameshift site short sequence rsv rna 147 nucleotide length contain frameshift site stem-loop structure sufficient direct frameshifting novel genetic context,89

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

The genomic packaging signal (PS) for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was originally identified as an element that conferred packaging capability to defective interfering RNAs. The MHV PS is an RNA structure that maps to the region of the replicase gene encoding the nonstructural protein 15 subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. To begin to understand the role and mechanism of action of the MHV PS in its native genomic locus, we constructed viral mutants in which this cis-acting element was altered, deleted, or transposed. Our results demonstrated that the PS is pivotal in the selection of viral genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. Mutants in which PS RNA secondary structure was disrupted or entirely ablated packaged large quantities of subgenomic RNAs, in addition to genomic RNA. Moreover, the PS retained its function when displaced to an ectopic site in the genome.

METHODS Cases of LVIHR from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2007 were identified from the Lothian Surgical Audit database. Patients were contacted by telephone after a minimum of 11 months following operation. Pseudo-recurrences were identified by history and clinical examination, together with radiological investigation if the diagnosis remained in doubt. RESULTS One hundred and forty-three repairs were performed in the study period. One hundred and twenty-one patients were contacted (63 incisional and 58 other ventral herniae). Twenty possible recurrences were reported (16.5%). Four were true recurrences and two more were new incisional herniae. There were 14 pseudo-recurrences, arising after 12 incisional and two other ventral hernia repairs. These were due to mesh bulge (10), seroma (3) and retained hernia contents (1).

Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the pandemic in the UK. METHODS A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from 'day zero' of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and continued for thirty days. We collected data on time-to-surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same thirty-day period in 2018, 2019 and the previous six months (Control groups A, B and C, respectively). RESULTS 43 patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P=0.022), B (P=0.003) and C (P=0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the seven mortalities recorded, four patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection. In our Study group, COVID-19 infection correlated significantly with 30-day mortality (P=0.002, odds ratio 2.4). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated a significant increase in 30-day mortality amongst hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.

Since the risk of colorectal cancer in CD predominant in the colon is probaly underestimated, a systematic colonoscopy after 8 to 10 years of evolution should be performed for the screening of malignant lesions. Colonoscopy is also useful for the treatment of complications of CD, i. e. dilatation of benign strictures, as well as localization and treatment of distal bleeding.

It is also prone to considerable inter- and intra-rater variability. Moreover, it involves considerable training and experience, and is very tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Hence, automatic sleep staging is needed to overcome these limitations. Since naturally occurring NREM sleep and anesthesia have been reported to possess various underlying neurophysiological similarities, EEG-based depth-of-anesthesia monitors have started to penetrate into sleep research. This study investigates the ability of WAV(CNS) index (as implemented in NeuroSENSE depth-of-anesthesia monitor) to detect NREM sleep stages and wake state for full overnight PSG data. METHODS Full overnight PSG sleep data, obtained from 24 adolescents, was scored by a registered PSG technologist for different sleep stages. Retrospective analysis was performed on a single frontal channel using the WAV(CNS) algorithm. Non-parametric descriptive statistics were used to examine the relationship between WAV(CNS) index and sleep stages. RESULTS A strong correlation (ρ = 0.9458) was found between the WAV(CNS) index and NREM sleep stages, with WAV(CNS) index values decreasing with increasing sleep stages. Moreover, there was no significant overlap between different NREM sleep stages as classified by the WAV(CNS) index, which was able to significantly differentiate (P < 0.001) between all pairs of Awake and different NREM stages. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that changes in the depth of natural NREM sleep are reflected sensitively by changes in the WAV(CNS) index. Hence, WAV(CNS) index may serve as an automatic real-time indicator of depth of natural sleep with high temporal resolution, and can possibly be of great use for automated sleep staging in routine/postoperative somnographic studies.",2011,"Agrawal, Gracee; Modarres, Mohammad; Zikov, Tatjana; Bibian, Stephane",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-011-9290-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789744/,734308.0,en,visual score 30-s epoch sleep datum adequate dynamic structure sleep sufficient detail prone considerable inter- intra-rater variability involve considerable train experience tedious time-consuming labor-intensive costly automatic sleep stage need overcome limitation naturally occur nrem sleep anesthesia report possess underlie neurophysiological similarity eeg-based depth-of-anesthesia monitor start penetrate sleep research study investigate ability wav(cns index implement neurosense depth-of-anesthesia monitor detect nrem sleep stage wake state overnight psg datum methods overnight psg sleep datum obtain 24 adolescent score register psg technologist different sleep stage retrospective analysis perform single frontal channel use wav(cns algorithm non-parametric descriptive statistic use examine relationship wav(cns index sleep stage results strong correlation ρ 0.9458 find wav(cns index nrem sleep stage wav(cns index value decrease increase sleep stage significant overlap different nrem sleep stage classify wav(cns index able significantly differentiate p 0.001 pair awake different nrem stage conclusions study demonstrate change depth natural nrem sleep reflect sensitively change wav(cns index wav(cns index serve automatic real-time indicator depth natural sleep high temporal resolution possibly great use automate sleep stage routine/postoperative somnographic study,171

METHODS: This is a nationwide retrospective case-control study of 219,961 individuals, aged 18 years or older, whose medical costs for COVID-19 testing were claimed until May 15, 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis and infection severity were identified from reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and on the basis of respiratory support use, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (7,341 of 219,961) was young and had a high proportion of female. Overall, 13.0% (954 of 7,341) of the cases were severe.

As in the case of developing fields, ethical approaches are not well developed in the collection, processing, and analysis of participants’ information. Existing controversies and varying national ethical regulations can, thus, hamper efficient cross-border research collaboration to the detriment of quality disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review characterizes current practices on how ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) pertinent to research ethics are handled by different Influenzanet country groups to analyze similarities and identify the need for further harmonization of ethical approaches. METHODS: A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, Global Digital Library on Ethics, and Bioethics Literature Database to identify ELSIs for Influenzanet country platforms. Only English-language papers were included with publication dates from 2003 to 2017. Publications were screened for the application of bioethics principles in the implementation of country platforms. Additional publications gathered from the Influenzanet Consortium website, reference screening, and conference proceeding were screened for ELSIs. RESULTS: We gathered 96 papers from our search methodology. In total, 28 papers that mentioned ELSIs were identified and included in this study. The Research Ethics Committee (REC) approvals were sought for recruiting participants and collecting their data in 8 of 11 country platforms and informed e-consent was sought from participants in 9 of 11 country platforms. Furthermore, personal data protection was ensured throughout the Consortium using data anonymization before processing and analysis and using aggregated data. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemics forecasting activities, such as Influenzanet, are beneficial; however, its benefits could be further increased through the harmonization of data gathering and ethical requirements. This objective is achievable by the Consortium. More transparency should be promoted concerning REC-approved research for Influenzanet-like systems. The validity of informed e-consent could also be increased through the provision of a user friendly and standard information sheet across the Consortium where participants agree to its terms, conditions, and privacy policies before being able to fill in the questionnaire.

In this solid-tumor model, high tumor uptake of targeting peptides was expected. However, in vivo SPECT images showed substantial heterogeneous radioactivity accumulation despite homogenous receptor distribution in the tumor xenografts as assessed by in vitro autoradiography. We hypothesized that delivery of peptide to the tumor cells is dictated by adequate local tumor perfusion. To study this relationship, sequential SPECT/CT and MRI were performed to assess the role of vascular functionality in radiopeptide accumulation. METHODS High-resolution SPECT and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI were acquired in six mice bearing PC295 PDX tumors expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor. Two hours prior to SPECT imaging, animals received 25 MBq (111)In(DOTA-(βAla)2-JMV594) (25 pmol). Images were acquired using multipinhole SPECT/CT. Directly after SPECT imaging, MR images were acquired on a 7.0-T dedicated animal scanner. DCE-MR images were quantified using semi-quantitative and quantitative models. The DCE-MR and SPECT images were spatially aligned to compute the correlations between radioactivity and DCE-MRI-derived parameters over the tumor. RESULTS Whereas histology, in vitro autoradiography, and multiple-weighted MRI scans all showed homogenous tissue characteristics, both SPECT and DCE-MRI showed heterogeneous distribution patterns throughout the tumor. The average Spearman's correlation coefficient between SPECT and DCE-MRI ranged from 0.57 to 0.63 for the ""exchange-related"" DCE-MRI perfusion parameters. CONCLUSIONS A positive correlation was shown between exchange-related DCE-MRI perfusion parameters and the amount of radioactivity accumulated as measured by SPECT, demonstrating that vascular function was an important aspect of radiopeptide distribution in solid tumors. The combined use of SPECT and MRI added crucial information on the perfusion efficiency versus radiopeptide uptake in solid tumors and showed that functional tumor characteristics varied locally even when the tissue appeared homogenous on current standard assessment techniques.",2016,"Haeck, J C; Bol, K; de Ridder, C M A; Brunel, L; Fehrentz, J A; Martinez, J; van Weerden, W M; Bernsen, M R; de Jong, M; Veenland, J F",EJNMMI research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-016-0160-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769345/,1163519.0,en,background model system solid-tumor patient-derived xenograft pdx model characterize high peptide receptor expression histological tissue homogeneity use study radiopeptide target solid-tumor model high tumor uptake target peptide expect vivo spect image substantial heterogeneous radioactivity accumulation despite homogenous receptor distribution tumor xenograft assess vitro autoradiography hypothesize delivery peptide tumor cell dictate adequate local tumor perfusion study relationship sequential spect/ct mri perform assess role vascular functionality radiopeptide accumulation methods high-resolution spect dynamic contrast-enhanced (dce)-mri acquire mouse bear pc295 pdx tumor express gastrin-releasing peptide grp receptor hour prior spect image animal receive 25 mbq (111)in(dota-(βala)2-jmv594 25 pmol images acquire use multipinhole spect/ct directly spect image mr image acquire 7.0-t dedicate animal scanner dce-mr image quantify use semi-quantitative quantitative model dce-mr spect image spatially align compute correlation radioactivity dce-mri-derived parameter tumor results histology vitro autoradiography multiple-weighted mri scan homogenous tissue characteristic spect dce-mri heterogeneous distribution pattern tumor average spearman correlation coefficient spect dce-mri range 0.57 0.63 exchange-related dce-mri perfusion parameter conclusions positive correlation exchange-related dce-mri perfusion parameter radioactivity accumulate measure spect demonstrate vascular function important aspect radiopeptide distribution solid tumor combine use spect mri add crucial information perfusion efficiency versus radiopeptide uptake solid tumor functional tumor characteristic vary locally tissue appear homogenous current standard assessment technique,202
109538,863nt8yy,,WHO,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using commercially available reagents,,,,unk,"Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was initially recognized in Wuhan, China and subsequently spread to all continents. The disease primarily affects the lower respiratory system, but may involve other organs and systems. Histopathologic evaluation of tissue from affected patients is crucial for diagnostic purposes, but also for advancing our understanding of the disease. For that reason, we developed immunohistochemical (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for detection of the. virus. A total of eight autopsy lungs, one placenta, and ten kidney biopsies from COVID-19 patients were stained with a panel of commercially available antibodies for IHC and commercially available RNA probes for ISH. Similarly, autopsy lungs, placentas and renal biopsies from non-COVID-19 patients were stained with the same antibodies and probes.

A regular and structured platform was developed for use between participants from state level public health authorities, the military and the RKI.

OBJECTIVES To determine whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements, or both, prevent the development of AMD. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 29 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 29 March 2017), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1985 to 29 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 29 March 2017, the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 29 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 29 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 29 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5; the other author checked the data entry. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of five RCTs in this review with data available for 76,756 people. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, and the USA, and investigated vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements. All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias.Four studies reported the comparison of vitamin E with placebo. Average treatment and follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 10 years. Data were available for a total of 55,614 participants. There was evidence that vitamin E supplements do not prevent the development of any AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence), and may slightly increase the risk of late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.95; very low-certainty evidence), and four cases of geographic atrophy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 26.0; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported similar numbers of adverse events in the vitamin E and placebo groups. Another trial reported excess of haemorrhagic strokes in the vitamin E group (39 versus 23 events, hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91, low-certainty evidence).Two studies reported the comparison of beta-carotene with placebo. These studies took place in Finland and the USA. Both trials enrolled men only. Average treatment and follow-up duration was 6 years and 12 years. Data were available for a total of 22,083 participants. There was evidence that beta-carotene supplements did not prevent any AMD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence) nor have an important effect on late AMD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.15; very low-certainty evidence) and 4 cases of geographic atrophy (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.03 to 2.93; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked.One study reported the comparison of vitamin C with placebo, and multivitamin (Centrum Silver) versus placebo. This was a study in men in the USA with average treatment duration and follow-up of 8 years for vitamin C and 11 years for multivitamin. Data were available for a total of 14,236 participants. AMD was assessed by self-report followed by medical record review. There was evidence that vitamin C supplementation did not prevent any AMD (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (RR 0.94, 0.61 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a slight increased risk of any AMD (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69; moderate-certainty evidence) in the multivitamin group. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were not reported separately. Adverse effects were not reported but there was possible increased risk of skin rashes in the multivitamin group.Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos.None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects, and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended.

Methods Using the number of daily confirmed cases from January 23 to March 22, 2020 and their symptom onset date from the official website of the Seoul metropolitan government and the district office, we calculated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. Separate analyses were conducted with the symptom onset date of asymptomatic cases considered as -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2 days of the confirmed date. Results A propagated epidemic curve was found on the basis of the 313 confirmed cases. The daily Rt based on the number of daily confirmed cases peaked at 2.6 on February 20, and decreased to <1.0 starting on March 3. Rt calculated based on the number of daily onset cases showed a similar pattern, although the variation in Rt was greater when using the number of daily confirmed cases. Changing the assumed onset date for asymptomatic cases (from -2 to +2 days of the confirmed date) did not yield meaningful changes in the results.

Intubation with Shikani Optical Stylet (SOS) has become increasingly popular in difficult airway. We compared the effects of intubation with SOS versus Macintosh laryngoscope (MLS) in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. METHODS A total of 270 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis of spinal cord and nerve root type from August 2012 to January 2016 were enrolled and randomly allocated to the MLS or SOS group by random numbers. Patients were evaluated for difficult airway preoperatively, and Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy classification was determined during anesthesia induction. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane Grades III-IV. Patients were intubated with the randomly assigned intubation device. The success rate, intubation time, required assistance, immediate complications, and postoperative complaints were recorded. Categorical variables were analyzed by Chi-square test, and continuous variables were analyzed by independent samples t-test or rank sum test. RESULTS The success rate of intubation among normal airways was 100% in both groups. In patients with difficult airway, the success rates in the MLS and SOS groups were 84.2% and 94.1%, respectively (P = 0.605). Intubation with SOS took longer compared with MLS (normal airway: 25.1 ± 5.8 s vs. 24.5 ± 5.7 s, P = 0.426; difficult airway: 38.5 ± 8.5 s vs. 36.1 ± 8.2 s, P = 0.389). Intubation with SOS required less assistance in patients with difficult airway (5.9% vs. 100%, P< 0.001). The frequency of postoperative sore throat was lower in SOS group versus MLS group in patients with normal airway (22.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS SOS is a safe and effective airway management device in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. Compared with MLS, SOS appears clinically beneficial for intubation, especially in patients with difficult airway.

125447,ontqzmfr,,WHO,COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspective from Italian Pediatric Emergency Physicians,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: To document the lived experience of Italian pediatric emergency physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed a structured interview to collect the lived experience of the staff of the Pediatric emergency department (PED) of a tertiary referral university hospital in Northern Italy. The open-ended questions were draft according to the suggestions of Canadian colleagues and administered by one interviewer, who was part of the PED staff, at the end of March 2020. All the PED staff was interviewed, on a voluntary basis, using purposive sampling. RESULTS: Most respondents declared to be afraid of becoming infected and of infecting their families. The number of patients seen in the PED has decreased, and the cases tend to be more severe. A shift in the clinical approach to the ill child has occurred, the physical examination is problem-oriented, aiming to avoid un-necessary maneuvers and to minimize the number of practitioners involved. The most challenging aspects reported are: (1) performing a physical examination in personal protective equipment (PPE); (2) being updated with rapidly evolving guidelines; (3) staying focused on the possible COVID-19 clinical presentation without failing in differential diagnosis.

However, the comparative effects of different expectation inductions, such as verbal suggestion or mental imagery, and their generic effects on physical sensitivity, to different sensations such as pain, itch, and fatigue, are still largely unknown. In the current study, we assessed the individual and combined effects of verbal suggestion and imagery on pain, itch, and fatigue as indicators of physical sensitivity in a randomized study design. Healthy participants (n = 116) were given an inert (placebo) capsule that was said to be effective for reducing physical sensitivity in either the majority (positive verbal suggestion) or the minority (control verbal suggestion) of users. Subsequently, they imagined either their best possible health (positive imagery) or a typical day (control imagery). Sensitivity to pain, itch, and fatigue was tested using a cold pressor test, histamine iontophoresis, and a bicycle test, respectively. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded continuously. Results showed that positive verbal suggestion and imagery successfully induced positive expectations, but they did not affect physical sensitivity, as indicated by sensitivity to pain, itch, or fatigue, or concurrent physiological responses. These results could indicate that the specificity and concreteness of expectation inductions might be important for their applicability in the treatment of physical symptoms.

Materials and methods An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials.

It is unclear how effective this is in comparison to other forms of intravesical therapy. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of intravesical EMDA for the treatment of NMIBC. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE), two clinical trial registries and a grey literature repository. We searched reference lists of relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The last search was February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised studies comparing EMDA of any intravesical agent used to reduce bladder cancer recurrence in conjunction with transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to GRADE on a per outcome basis. MAIN RESULTS We included three trials with 672 participants that described five distinct comparisons. The same principal investigator conducted all three trials. All studies used mitomycin C (MMC) as the chemotherapeutic agent for EMDA. 1. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus postoperative Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, we are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.76; corresponding to 30 more per 1000 participants, 95% CI 180 fewer to 380 more). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.11). 2. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus MMC-passive diffusion (PD) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with CIS and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, postoperative MMC-EMDA may (low QoE) reduce disease recurrence (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98; corresponding to 147 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 235 fewer to 8 fewer). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 8.45). 3. Postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG induction and maintenance versus postoperative BCG induction and maintenance: based on one study with 212 participants with pT1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with or without CIS, postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG may result (low QoE) in a longer time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; corresponding to 181 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 256 fewer to 79 fewer) and time to progression (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; corresponding to 63 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 82 fewer to 24 fewer). We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.94). 4. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus single-dose, postoperative MMC-PD: based on one study with 236 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; corresponding to 247 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 341 fewer to 130 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.00 to 259.93; corresponding to 34 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 193 fewer to 807 more) and serious adverse events (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.05). 5. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus TURBT alone: based on one study with 233 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; corresponding to 304 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 390 fewer to 198 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.00 to 247.93; corresponding to 49 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 207 fewer to 793 more) or serious adverse events (HR 1.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.77). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS While the use of EMDA to administer intravesical MMC may result in a delay in time to recurrence in select patient populations, we are uncertain about its impact on serious adverse events in all settings.

The number of reports on newly obtained VLPs has grown proportionally with the systems developed for the expression of these particles. The chapter outlines the recent achievements in two important fields of research brought about by the availability of VLPs produced in a foreign host. These are: (1) The requirements for VLP assembly and (2) the use of VLPs as carriers for foreign epitopes. VLP technology is a rapidly advancing domain of molecular and structural biology. Extensive progress in VLP studies was achieved as the insect cell based protein production system was developed. This baculovirus expression system has many advantages for the synthesis of viral structural proteins resulting in the formation of VLPs. It allows production of large amounts of correctly folded proteins while also providing cell membranes that can serve as structural elements for enveloped viruses. These features give us the opportunity to gain insights into the interactions and requirements accompanying VLP formation that are similar to the assembly events occurring in mammalian cells. Other encouraging elements are the ability to easily scale up the system and the simplicity of purification of the assembled VLPs. The growing number of VLPs carrying foreign protein fragments on their surface and studies on the successful assembly of these chimeric molecules is a promising avenue towards the development of a new technology, in which the newly designed VLPs will be directed to particular mammalian cell types by exposing specific binding domains. The progress made in modeling the surface of VLPs makes them to date the best candidates for the design of delivery systems that can efficiently reach their targets.",2005-12-31,"Palucha, Andrzej; Loniewska, Adrianna; Satheshkumar, Subbian; Boguszewska‐Chachulska, Anna M.; Umashankar, Mahadevaiah; Milner, Malgorzata; Haenni, Anne‐Lise; Savithri, Handanahal Subbarao",Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/794906ba7f4f57e267f5b6af538f42a7c783d039.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119358.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16164974/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079660305800042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079660305800042,19930880.0,en,publisher summary virus‐like particle vlps form structural element virus receive considerable attention past decade numb report newly obtain vlps grow proportionally system develope expression particle chapter outline recent achievement important field research bring availability vlps produce foreign host 1 requirement vlp assembly 2 use vlps carrier foreign epitope vlp technology rapidly advance domain molecular structural biology extensive progress vlp study achieve insect cell base protein production system develope baculovirus expression system advantage synthesis viral structural protein result formation vlps allow production large correctly fold protein provide cell membrane serve structural element envelop virus feature opportunity gain insight interaction requirement accompany vlp formation similar assembly event occur mammalian cell encourage element ability easily scale system simplicity purification assemble vlps grow numb vlps carry foreign protein fragment surface study successful assembly chimeric molecule promise avenue development new technology newly design vlps direct particular mammalian cell type expose specific bind domain progress model surface vlps date candidate design delivery system efficiently reach target,160

Medical aids were rushed to Hubei and new hospitals were rapidly built, however, the healthcare system was still unable to match the staggering increase of patients in the early stages of the lockdowns. The paper proposes using patient evacuation to enhance sustainable COVID-19 mitigation during lockdowns.

Principles of a multisystem perspective on resilience and major findings on what matters for young people in disasters are delineated with reference to the pandemic. Striking parallels are noted in the psychosocial resilience factors identified at the level of individual children, families, schools, and communities. These parallels suggest that adaptive capacities associated with resilience in these interacting systems reflect interconnected networks and processes that co-evolved and may operate in concert.

Infection possesses unique characteristics that account for this disproportionate degree of fear: it is transmitted rapidly and invisibly; historically, it has accounted for major morbidity and mortality; old forms re-emerge and new forms emerge; and both the media and society are often in awe. Because, in an outbreak, the patient is both a victim and a vector, and because there exists the potential for infringement of personal rights in order to control an outbreak, infection may be viewed (and has been depicted in popular culture) as a foreign invasion. During recent outbreaks, fear, denial, stigmatization and loss have been recorded in the implicated individuals. Stigmatization and discrimination may further involve ethical correlations, and attempts to adress these issues through activism may also have unwarranted effects.

The OrVil system (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) is one of those methods, but its technical and oncologic feasibility have not been proven and need to be observed. METHODS Among 87 patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG; 79 cases) and laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy with double tract anastomosis (LAPG_DT; 8 cases) from April 2004, 47 patients underwent the conventional extracorporeal method (Group I; 2004-2008) were compared with 40 patients treated with the intracorporeal OrVil system (Group II; 2009-2012). RESULTS There was no significant difference in clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups except tumor location; more cardia lesions were involved in group II (p = 0.012). The mean time for esophagojejunostomy (E-J), defined as the time from anvil insertion to closure of the jejunal entry site has no significant difference (Group I vs II: 22.2 ± 3.2 min vs 18.6 ± 3.5 min, p = 0.623). In terms of anastomotic complication, there was no significant difference in E-J leakage and stricture. E-J leakage occurred in 2 out of 47 (4.3%) cases in group I and 2 out of 40 (5%) in group II (p = 0.628); half of them were treated conservatively in each group and the others underwent reoperation.

Hematological patients as immunocompromised hosts are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is rare information available regarding the clinical features of hematological patients concomitant with COVID-19. In this study, 9 concomitant patients were analyzed for their clinical manifestations, the laboratory data, radiological findings and immunologic features. The median age was 50 years (range, 17-68) and 6 patients were male. 7 patients were infected via hospital-associated transmission and other 2 via community-associated transmission. Onset of COVID-19 in all patients occurred during routine treatments for their hematological diseases. 8 patients were classified as moderate and 1 patient as critically ill COVID-19. 4 patients died, 1 from leukemia progression, 2 from life-threatening secondary infection and the other one from respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Abruptly elevated level of cytokines was often correlated with progressive hematological disease or concurrent bacterial infections. 2 patients had the atypical CT imaging findings of COVID-19.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,10.1186/s13054-017-1796-9,,28774325,unk,"BACKGROUND The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders,' (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment. METHODS Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment. RESULTS A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9-62.7) where <500 ml was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9-61.0) where 500 ml was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9-79.2) where >500 ml was administered (p = 0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for <15 minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2-64.1) and for 15-30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4-62.4, p = 1). Where the infusion time was ≥30 minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6-54, p = 0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10 minutes, and >10 minutes after the fluid challenge.

METHODS: The demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and prognosis from 15 cases of pSS-LIP patients were retrospectively analyzed. The data were compared with t test, χ(2) test, and Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) Fifteen cases of patients with pSS-LIP are all females (100%). Compared with pSS with interstitial lung disease(pSS-ILD) patients, the incidence of dry cough, dental caries is higher in pSS-LIP patients. The incidence of shortness of breath, weight loss, and crackles is lower in pSS-LIP patients than that of pSS-ILD patients. (2) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, pSS-LIP patients had higher percentage of patients with ANA, anti-SSA52KD antibody, anti-SSA60KD antibody, and anti-SSB antibody, and the higher concentration of serum globulin. (3) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, the frequency of obstructive ventilation dysfunction is significantly higher and the frequency of diffusion dysfunction is significantly lower in pSS-LIP patients. (4) The most frequent HRCT findings in patients with pSS-LIP is cysts (100%), followed by ground-glass opacities (73.3%), nodular shadow (73.3%) among the pSS-LIP patients. Compared with PSS-ILD patients, the incidence of pulmonary nodule shadow is significantly higher in PSS-LIP patients, while that of grid shadow was significantly lower. (5) Compared with the baseline, the sum of the number, maximum diameter, and diameter of cysts in three levels of pSS-LIP patients showed an increasing trend after treatment. (6) Correlation analysis: The changes of ground-glass opacities were positively correlated with using GC or not, and those were negatively correlated with the dose of GC treatment. Besides, there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the maximum diameter of cysts (△Ømax1/t) and the use of CTX; there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the total diameter of cysts (△Øsum1/t) and the use of CTX. CONCLUSION: To the patients of pSS-LIP, female were more common than male, and the onset of LIP was usually more insidious. Hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. The appearance of ground-glass opacities in pSS-LIP patients suggests that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increases, which may cause airway compression, the expansion of terminal bronchioles, and the formation of cysts. The more ground-glass opacities appear earlier, and the more appearance of new cysts later. Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage. The heavier ground-glass opacity is at baseline, the more likely it will recur during maintenance treatment.

METHODS We analyzed 319 patients (220 asymptomatic and 99 symptomatic) who underwent carotid angioplasty from 2002 until 2012 for CR that occurred after eversion endarterectomy. During this period, 7993 eversion endarterectomies were done for significant carotid artery stenosis. Significant CR was detected by ultrasound examination and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography or multidetector computed tomography angiography. After angioplasty (with or without stenting), color duplex ultrasound imaging was done after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. End points encompassed myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (fatal myocardial infarction, fatal cardiac failure, fatal stroke), and also puncture site hematoma and recurrent restenosis. Primary end points were analyzed as early results (≤30 days after the procedure), and secondary end points were long-term results (>30 days). Variables and risk factors influencing the early-term and long-term results were also analyzed. Median follow-up was 49.8 ± 22.8 months (range, 17-121 months). RESULTS All but one procedure ended with a technical success (99.7%). In the early postoperative period, transient ischemic attack occurred in 2.8% of the patients and stroke in 1.6%, followed by one lethal outcome (0.3%). Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.3%) several hours after the angioplasty, followed by urgent surgery and graft interposition. In the long-term follow-up, there were no transient ischemic attacks or strokes, non-neurologic mortality was 3.13%, and the recurrent restenosis rate was 4.4%. The rate of non-neurologic outcomes during the follow-up was significantly higher in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (4.54% vs 0%; P = .034). The statically highest rate of transient ischemic attack was verified in patients in whom Precise (Cordis Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ) stents was used (12.2%) and a Spider Fx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) cerebral protection device (12.5%) was used. Female gender, coronary artery disease, plaque calcifications, and smoking history were associated with an adverse outcome after angioplasty.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To obtain a thorough understanding of substrate specificity of the protease, a substrate library of 19[Image: see text]8 variants was created by performing saturation mutagenesis on the autocleavage sequence at P5 to P3' positions. The substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. P5 and P3 positions prefer residues with high β-sheet propensity; P4 prefers small hydrophobic residues; P2 prefers hydrophobic residues without β-branch. Gln is the best residue at P1 position, but observable cleavage can be detected with His and Met substitutions. P1' position prefers small residues, while P2' and P3' positions have no strong preference on residue substitutions. Noteworthy, solvent exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3' positions favour positively charged residues over negatively charged one, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a role in catalysis. A super-active substrate, which combined the preferred residues at P5 to P1 positions, was found to have 2.8 fold higher activity than the wild-type sequence.

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore has routinely fit-tested staff for high filtration N95 respirators, and established web-based staff surveillance systems. The routine systems were enhanced in response to Singapore's first imported COVID-19 case on January 23,2020. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, from January 23,2020 to February 23,2020, among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital co-located with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of February 23,2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multi-pronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures:(1) Risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) Staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) Enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff. RESULTS: A total of 10,583 staff were placed on hospital-wide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1,524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of eight staff illness episodes was seen per day, and almost 10% (n=29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19.

Accurate prediction of the binding between short peptides and the MHC molecules has long been a principal challenge for immunoinformatics. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions: instead of categorizing peptides as ""binders"" or ""non-binders"" or as ""strong binders"" and ""weak binders"", recent methods seek to make predictions about precise binding affinities. RESULTS: We developed a quantitative support vector machine regression (SVR) approach, called SVRMHC, to model peptide-MHC binding affinities. As a non-linear method, SVRMHC was able to generate models that out-performed existing linear models, such as the ""additive method"". By adopting a new ""11-factor encoding"" scheme, SVRMHC takes into account similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids constituting the input peptides. When applied to MHC-peptide binding data for three mouse class I MHC alleles, the SVRMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced previously. Furthermore, comparisons based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that SVRMHC was able to out-perform several prominent methods in identifying strongly binding peptides.

Phlebovirus glycoproteins (GP) play a key role in targeting viral structural components to the budding compartments in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi complex. However, the role of SFTSV GP in targeting structural proteins to the ERGIC and Golgi complex remains unresolved. In this study, we show that SFTSV GP plays a significant role in targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) to the budding sites. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular localization of SFTSV structural proteins. In SFTSV-infected cells, GP and L localized to the ER, ERGIC and Golgi complex, whereas NP localized to the ERGIC and Golgi complex. In addition, GP colocalized with L and NP in infected cells. In cells singly transfected with GP, L or NP, GP localized to the same subcellular compartments as in infected cells. However, L or NP alone did not localize to the ER, ERGIC, or Golgi complex. Cotransfection experiments showed that GP altered the localization of L to the ERGIC and Golgi complex but not that of NP. Interestingly, plasmid-expressed NP fused with a hemagglutinin tag localized to the ERGIC and Golgi complex when expressed in SFTSV-infected cells and colocalised with GP, suggesting that GP plays a role in the subcellular localization of L and NP in infected cells. Thus, the SFTSV structural components start to assemble at the ERGIC to Golgi complex. GP is required for transporting L and NP to the ERGIC and Golgi complex.

88049,s230azhx,,Medline,Acceleration in the rate of CNS remyelination in lysolecithin-induced demyelination.,,,9502810,unk,"One important therapeutic goal during CNS injury from trauma or demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is to develop methods to promote remyelination. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous remyelination in the toxic nonimmune model of lysolecithin-induced demyelination can be enhanced by manipulating the inflammatory response. In PBS-treated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH94.03, developed for its ability to promote remyelination in the Theiler's virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating axons per lesion area at 3 weeks by a factor of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diameter or the number of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in the lesion. After 3 weeks, the number of remyelinating axons in the methylprednisolone or mAb SCH94.03 treatment groups was similar to the spontaneous remyelination in the 5 week PBS control-treated group, indicating that these treatments promoted remyelination by increasing its rate rather than its extent.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs.

Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care. Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic. A novel coronavirus — officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 by the authorities — emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019 [1, 2]. Just four months later, more than 100,000 cases have been diagnosed with the resulting disease, COVID-19, in more than 100 countries at the time of writing this paper [3]. Not only does mainland China have the most number of reported cases (94.4%), but its case-fatality rate is also relatively higher than that of other countries as of February 28, 2020 (China: 3.5%, 2,791 deaths among 78,961 confirmed cases; other countries: 1.4%, 67 deaths among 4,691 confirmed cases) [4]. In an attempt to restrict the outbreak, China quickly implemented an unprecedented measure of quarantining 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities, but its impact on slowing the global spread of the virus now seems inadequate. In fact, the number of cases in local human-to-human transmission kept soaring in several countries as of March 25, 2020: Italy 63,927 cases, United States of America 42,164 cases, and Spain 33,089 cases [3].

It is the only approved drug for Human use in the large class of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This natural product, mainly isolated from the plant Stephania cephalantha Hayata, exhibits multiple pharmacological properties including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-parasitic properties. Purpose The mechanism of action of CEP is multifactorial. The drug exerts membrane effects (modulation of efflux pumps, membrane rigidification) as well as different intracellular and nuclear effects. CEP interferes with several metabolic axes, primarily with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NFκB signaling pathways. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of CEP rely on AMPK activation and NFκB inhibition. Conclusion In this review, the historical discovery and development of CEP are retraced, and the key mediators involved in its mode of action are presented. The past, present, and future of CEP are recapitulated.

In this study, a total of 145 insectivorous bats representing six species were collected from northern China and screened with degenerate primers for viruses belonging to six families, including coronaviruses, astroviruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses. Our study found that four of the viruses screened for were positive and the overall detection rates for astroviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses in bats were 21.4%, 15.9%, 20% and 37.2%, respectively. In addition, we found that bats in northern China harboured a diversity of novel viruses.

We identify cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) as an interacting partner of the viral SARS-unique domain (SUD) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)), and, as a consequence, the involvement of cellular p53 as antagonist of coronaviral replication. Residues 95-144 of RCHY1 and 389-652 of SUD (SUD-NM) subdomains are crucial for interaction. Association with SUD increases the stability of RCHY1 and augments RCHY1-mediated ubiquitination as well as degradation of p53. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D), which normally influences RCHY1 stability by phosphorylation, also binds to SUD. In vivo phosphorylation shows that SUD does not regulate phosphorylation of RCHY1 via CAMK2D. Similarly to SUD, the PL(pro)s from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 physically interact with and stabilize RCHY1, and thus trigger degradation of endogenous p53. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease is encoded next to SUD within nonstructural protein 3. A SUD-PL(pro) fusion interacts with RCHY1 more intensively and causes stronger p53 degradation than SARS-CoV PL(pro) alone. We show that p53 inhibits replication of infectious SARS-CoV as well as of replicons and human coronavirus NL63. Hence, human coronaviruses antagonize the viral inhibitor p53 via stabilizing RCHY1 and promoting RCHY1-mediated p53 degradation. SUD functions as an enhancer to strengthen interaction between RCHY1 and nonstructural protein 3, leading to a further increase in in p53 degradation. The significance of these findings is that down-regulation of p53 as a major player in antiviral innate immunity provides a long-sought explanation for delayed activities of respective genes.",2016,"Ma-Lauer, Yue; Carbajo-Lozoya, Javier; Hein, Marco Y; Müller, Marcel A; Deng, Wen; Lei, Jian; Meyer, Benjamin; Kusov, Yuri; von Brunn, Brigitte; Bairad, Dev Raj; Hünten, Sabine; Drosten, Christian; Hermeking, Heiko; Leonhardt, Heinrich; Mann, Matthias; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; von Brunn, Albrecht",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1603435113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27519799/,4370126.0,en,highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov develope strategy inhibit host immune recognition identify cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger chy zinc-finger domain-containing 1 rchy1 interact partner viral sars-unique domain sud papain-like protease pl(pro consequence involvement cellular p53 antagonist coronaviral replication residues 95 144 rchy1 389 652 sud sud-nm subdomain crucial interaction association sud increase stability rchy1 augment rchy1-mediated ubiquitination good degradation p53 calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii delta camk2d normally influence rchy1 stability phosphorylation bind sud vivo phosphorylation sud doe regulate phosphorylation rchy1 camk2d similarly sud pl(pro)s sars-cov mers-cov hcov-nl63 physically interact stabilize rchy1 trigger degradation endogenous p53 sars-cov papain-like protease encode sud nonstructural protein 3 sud-pl(pro fusion interact rchy1 intensively cause strong p53 degradation sars-cov pl(pro p53 inhibit replication infectious sars-cov good replicons human coronavirus nl63 human coronavirus antagonize viral inhibitor p53 stabilize rchy1 promote rchy1-mediated p53 degradation sud function enhancer strengthen interaction rchy1 nonstructural protein 3 lead far increase p53 degradation significance finding down-regulation p53 major player antiviral innate immunity provide long-sought explanation delay activity respective gene,169

However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri-Staple™ Technology combined with Endo GIA™ Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(®) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites.

The difference between the patients with URTI and healthy subjects in their response to airway vibration may be explained on the basis of hyperreactivity of airway sensory receptors. We propose that the model of cough induced by airway vibration may be useful for studies on the pathophysiology and pharmacology of airway hyperreactivity in acute cough.

However, little is known about pediatricians’ experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. Methods: Data from a nationally representative survey of AAP post-residency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n=744; response rate=48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which non-users would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. Results: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among non-users, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. Conclusion: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth.

Such assumptions, however, may not hold in the real world: (1) when there is a shortfall of all products, product substitution may be inadequate unless it is paired with other strategies such as dual sourcing; and (2) production lines do not survive forever and may fail. To relax such assumptions, this paper therefore investigates the situations that the manufacturer may optimize substitution policy and dual sourcing policy to cope with supply chain disruptions. The paper obtains and compares the optimal policies for both deterministic and stochastic demands.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of neck extension on the advancement of tracheal tubes from the nasal cavity into the oropharynx during nasotracheal intubation. METHODS Patients were randomized to the 'neck extension group (E group)' or 'neutral position group (N group)' for this randomized controlled trial. After induction of anesthesia, a nasal RAE tube was inserted via a nostril. For the E group, an anesthesiologist advanced the tube from the nasal cavity into the oropharynx with the patient's neck extended. For the N group, an anesthesiologist advanced the tube without neck extension. If the tube was successfully advanced into the oropharynx within two attempts by the same maneuver according to the assigned group, the case was defined as 'success.' We compared the success rate of tube advancement between the two groups. RESULTS Thirty-two patients in the E group and 33 in the N group completed the trial. The success rate of tube passage during the first two attempts was significantly higher in the E group than in the N group (93.8% vs. 60.6%; odds ratio = 9.75, 95% CI = [1.98, 47.94], p = 0.002).

The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m-3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g-1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg-1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream.

This procedure is less invasive than conventional open approaches, and the oncologic outcomes are comparable. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery, developed to reduce the invasiveness of traditional laparoscopy, is applied to various abdominal surgical procedures. However, its application to laparoscopic gastrectomy for the treatment of gastric cancer has not been reported, mainly because of difficulties achieving adequate lymphadenectomy and reconstruction. The authors report their initial clinical experience with single-incision laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. METHODS A single vertical 2.5-cm intraumbilical incision was made, and three laparoscopic trocars were placed within the umbilicus. A 2-mm mini-loop retractor was inserted in the left upper and middle abdomen, and a roll of gauze was attached to its tip. This instrument is an atraumatic and useful tool for retracting various organs. Gastric mobilization and adequate dissection of lymph nodes were performed. The stomach and duodenum then were transected intracorporeally using linear staplers. Intracorporeal anastomosis was performed for reconstruction. RESULTS All seven single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomies with lymphadenectomy were performed without the use of additional trocars or conversion to laparotomy. The median time for gastric mobilization with lymphadenectomy was 155 min (range, 130-183 min). The median operative time was 344 min (range, 282-385 min), and the median estimated blood loss was 25 ml (range, 0-100 ml). A median total of 67 lymph nodes were retrieved. No serious perioperative complications occurred, and no mortalities were observed in this case series. CONCLUSIONS The authors' initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy showed that it is a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer and gives a favorable cosmetic result.

The 24-form Tai Chi may exert a protective function for CHD patients after PCI by improving anxiety and depression. METHODS: Patients who received PCI after 1–4 days were randomly assigned to the 24-form Tai Chi group (TG) and the control group (CG). The differences in anxiety and depression, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36−item Short−Form Health Survey (SF-36), before and after an average of 10 months of Tai Chi intervention were compared in both groups to analyze the effects of Tai Chi on the emotion and the life quality of CHD patients. Meanwhile, the relative levels of miR-17-92 were measured by using real-time qPCR. The association between the relative levels of miR-17-92 and the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI was analyzed. Adjusted Cox models were used to explore the effect of Tai Chi exercise in CHD patients. RESULTS: After 10 months of intervention, the changes in the anxiety subscale (P = 0.002), in the depression subscale (P = 0.008), and in the stress (P = 0.015) scores were higher in the TG group when compared to those of the CG group. The proportion of anxious (P = 0.045) and depressed subjects (P = 0.042) in the TG group was lower than that in the CG group. On the other hand, the increase in the SF-36 scores and in the relative levels of miR-17-92 was significantly higher in the TG group when compared with that of the CG group (P < 0.05). The serum level of miR-17-92 had a negative correlation with the anxiety, the depression, and the stress scores (P < 0.01).

This study focused on the differences in preventive behaviors and psycho-social health of South Koreans, as people continue engaging in leisure activities under self-regulation without a lockdown measure imposed by the government. For the sample, the frame of the ""2018 Population and Housing Census"" in South Korea was applied, and data from 1770 people were analyzed. The results showed that the groups participating in culture and arts and social activities displayed characteristics with high prevention. Additionally, the groups that continued leisure activities for more than five years and with family showed high preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, participation in leisure activities with friends of the opposite sex lowered preventive behavior. In terms of psycho-social health, all groups were affiliated to the potential stress group and there were no differences in the period and participation time for leisure activities. Furthermore, the group participating in leisure activities with their school and group experienced psychological stability.

Therefore, our primary aim was to compare the concentration of l‐lactate to the concentration of neutrophils in sputum and systemic markers of infection. Because it is difficult to differentiate viral and bacterial infection on the basis of clinical presentation in LRTI, our secondary aim was to evaluate if l‐ and d‐lactate may serve as markers of local inflammation as representatives of neutrophils and bacteria, respectively. METHODS: Patients with acute LRTI were prospectively recruited. Sputum samples were collected and analysed for neutrophil count, l‐lactate and d‐lactate. We had data on pathogens from sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (atypical bacteria, virus) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) from blood. RESULTS: In 44 sputum samples from 32 patients, the median (interquartile range (IQR)) sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.615 × 10(7) cells/mL (0.236–1.575). The sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was associated with sputum l‐lactate (p = 0.011) and CRP (p = 0.018), but not with d‐lactate (p = 0.177). There was a strong association between sputum d‐lactate and l‐lactate (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: As l‐lactate in sputum is closely correlated to sequestration of neutrophils in the lungs, l‐lactate is a marker for local inflammation in LRTI and a potential biomarker in clinical management of LRTI.

Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations has advocated that facts and science should be promoted and that these constitute the antidote to the current infodemic.

Alendronate (ALN) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and results in reduced bone remodeling. This study investigated the effects of pre-emptive use of ALN on OA related osteoclastic subchondral bone resorption in an in vivo rat model for severe OA. Using multi-modality imaging we measured effects of ALN treatment within cartilage and synovium. Severe osteoarthritis was induced in left rat knees using papain injections in combination with a moderate running protocol. Twenty rats were treated with subcutaneous ALN injections and compared to twenty untreated controls. Animals were longitudinally monitored for 12weeks with in vivo μCT to measure subchondral bone changes and SPECT/CT to determine synovial macrophage activation using a folate-based radiotracer. Articular cartilage was analyzed at 6 and 12weeks with ex vivo contrast enhanced μCT and histology to measure sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and cartilage thickness. ALN treatment successfully inhibited subchondral bone remodeling. As a result we found less subchondral plate porosity and reduced osteophytosis. ALN treatment did not reduce subchondral sclerosis. However, after the OA induction phase, ALN treatment protected cartilage ECM from degradation and reduced synovial macrophage activation. Surprisingly, ALN treatment also improved sGAG content of tibia cartilage in healthy joints. Our data was consistent with the hypothesis that osteoclastic bone resorption might play an important role in OA and may be a driving force for progression of the disease. However, our study suggest that this effect might not solely be effects on osteoclastic activity, since ALN treatment also influenced macrophage functioning. Additionally, ALN treatment and physical activity exercised a positive effect in healthy control joints, which increased cartilage sGAG content.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. From December 2003 to May 2012, 64 patients were treated with MWA for a single hepatic lesion, in 64 sessions. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was treated in 25 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.33-cm; 95% CI, 2.65-4.18-cm; range, 1.0-12.0-cm), metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) was treated in 27 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 2.7-cm; 95% CI, 2.20-3.40-cm; range, 0.8-6.0-cm), and other histological-types were treated in 12 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.79-cm; 95% CI, 2.72-5.26-cm; range, 1.7-8.0-cm). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to analyze time event data. Chi-square and correlation evaluated the relationship between tumor size and treatment parameters. RESULTS Technical success rate was 95.3% (61/64). Treatment parameters were tailored to tumor size; as size increased more antennae were used (p<0.001), treatment with multiple activations increased (p<0.028), and treatment time increased (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship between time to recurrence and tumor size, number of activations, number of antennae, and treatment time. At one-year, K-M analysis predicted a likelihood of local recurrence of 39.8% in HCC patients, 45.7% in CRC metastases patients, and 70.8% in patients with other metastases. Median cancer specific survivals for patients were 38.3 months for HCC patients, 36.3 months for CRC metastases, and 13.9 months for other histological-types.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV.

Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14.

METHODS Thirty four patients of mean age 14.7 years completed both pulmonary function and maximal aerobic capacity tests at 6 months. All had normal clinical examination and were asymptomatic. Their exercise responses were compared with a group of healthy controls. Complete data were collected on 27 of the original 34 cases at 15 months. RESULTS Compared with normal controls, the patient group had significantly lower absolute and mass related peak oxygen consumption (peak V o(2) (p<0.01)), higher ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (p<0.01), lower oxygen pulse (p<0.01), and a lower oxygen uptake efficiency slope (p<0.01) at 6 months. This impairment was unexpected and out of proportion with the degree of lung function abnormality. Residual high resolution computed tomography of thorax (HRCT) abnormalities were present in 14 patients. Those with abnormal HRCT findings had significantly lower mass related peak V o(2) than subjects with normal radiology (p<0.01). Absolute and mass related peak V o(2) in the patient group remained impaired at 15 months despite normalisation of lung function in all patients.

98713,2hggvqfd,,WHO,The Psychological Causes of Panic Buying Following a Health Crisis,,,,unk,"Attributed to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, panic buying is now a frequent occurrence in many countries, leading to stockouts and supply chain disruptions. Consequently, it has received much attention from academics and the retail industry. The aim of this study is to review, identify, and synthesise the psychological causes of panic buying, which is a relatively new and unexplored area in consumer behaviour research. A systematic review of the related literature is conducted. The review suggests that panic buying is influenced by (1) individuals' perception of the threat of the health crisis and scarcity of products; (2) fear of the unknown, which is caused by negative emotions and uncertainty; (3) coping behaviour, which views panic buying as a venue to relieve anxiety and regain control over the crisis; and (4) social psychological factors, which account for the influence of the social network of an individual. This study contributes to the literature by consolidating the scarce and scattered research on the causes of panic buying, drawing greater theoretical insights into each cause and also offers some implications for health professionals, policy makers, and retailers on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to manage panic buying.

Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indígeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. FINDINGS: Of 99â557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11â321 patients in our study. 9278 (82·0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18·0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·45, 95% CI 1·33-1·58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1·32, 1·15-1·52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (e.g., atherosclerosis, lung diseases) and tumor diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via the tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization.

USP1 belongs to the cysteine protease family and contains a catalytic triad comprised of C90, H593, and D751. Notably, the catalytic activity of USP1 is stimulated through the formation of a tight complex with a WD40 repeat protein UAF1 (USP1-associated factor 1). Our kinetic analyses revealed a general base catalysis in USP1/UAF1, in contrast to an ion-pair mechanism as demonstrated for papain and cathepsin. The pK(a) value of the catalytic cysteine was determined to be 8.67 ± 0.07 in a pH-dependent inactivation study of USP1/UAF1 by iodoacetamide. A normal solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.8 for k(cat) and 3.0 for k(cat)/K(m) was observed in the USP1/UAF1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC substrate. Moreover, proton inventory analysis supported the transfer of a single solvent-derived proton in the transition state. Our study also revealed the molecular basis for the activation of USP1 by UAF1. Although the pK(a) of the catalytic cysteine in USP1 and USP1/UAF1 was almost identical, the pK(a) of the catalytic histidine in USP1/UAF1 was 0.43 pH unit lower than that in USP1, which facilitates general base catalysis at a neutral pH and contributes to the elevated catalytic efficiency. We ruled out that the higher catalytic efficiency is due to a tighter binding of ubiquitin. Our results support a regulatory mechanism in which UAF1 activates USP1 by modulating its active site conformation.

Intramuscular (IM) delivery can be preferred to intravenous delivery when initiating intravenous access is difficult or impossible. Drugs can be injected intramuscularly using a syringe or an automated delivery device (autoinjector). Investigation into the IM delivery dynamics of these methods may guide further improvements in the performance of injection technologies. Two porcine model studies were conducted to compare differences in dispersion of injectate volume for different methods of IM drug administration. The first study compared the differences in the degree of dispersion and uptake of injectate following the use of a manual syringe and an autoinjector. The second study compared the spatial spread of the injected formulation, or dispersion volume, and uptake of injectate following the use of five different autoinjectors (EpiPen(®) [0.3 mL], EpiPen(®) Jr [0.3 mL], Twinject(®) [0.15 mL, 0.3 mL], and Anapen(®) 300 [0.3 mL]) with varying needle length, needle gauge, and force applied to the plunger. In the first study, the autoinjector provided higher peak volumes of injectate, indicating a greater degree of dispersion, compared with manual syringe delivery. In the second study, EpiPen autoinjectors resulted in larger dispersion volumes and higher initial dispersion ratios, which decreased rapidly over time, suggesting a greater rate of uptake of injectate than the other autoinjectors. The differences in dispersion and uptake of injectate are likely the result of different functional characteristics of the delivery systems. Both studies demonstrate that the functional characteristics of the method for delivering IM injections impact the dispersion and uptake of the material injected, which could significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the drug.",2016,"Hill, Robert L; Wilmot, John G; Belluscio, Beth A; Cleary, Kevin; Lindisch, David; Tucker, Robin; Wilson, Emmanuel; Shukla, Rajesh B",Medical devices,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s83406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27536164/,13088851.0,en,parenteral route drug administration select optimize actual dose drug deliver assure high bioavailability bypass first-pass metabolism harsh gastrointestinal environment good maximize speed onset intramuscular im delivery prefer intravenous delivery initiate intravenous access difficult impossible drugs inject intramuscularly use syringe automate delivery device autoinjector investigation im delivery dynamic method guide far improvement performance injection technology porcine model study conduct compare difference dispersion injectate volume different method im drug administration ﻿1 study compare difference degree dispersion uptake injectate follow use manual syringe autoinjector 2 study compare spatial spread inject formulation dispersion volume uptake injectate follow use different autoinjectors epipen ® 0.3 ml epipen ® jr 0.3 ml twinject ® 0.15 ml 0.3 ml anapen ® 300 0.3 ml vary needle length needle gauge force apply plunger ﻿1 study autoinjector provide high peak volume injectate indicate great degree dispersion compare manual syringe delivery 2 study epipen autoinjectors result large dispersion volume high initial dispersion ratio decrease rapidly time suggest great rate uptake injectate autoinjectors difference dispersion uptake injectate likely result different functional characteristic delivery system study demonstrate functional characteristic method deliver im injection impact dispersion uptake material inject significantly affect pharmacokinetics ultimately effectiveness drug,191

Longitudinal assessment of cumulative adversities by socioeconomic position in the first 3 weeks of lockdown in the UK,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Despite media claims that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uniting societies and countries in shared experience, there has been concern that the pandemic is in fact exposing and widening existing inequalities within societies. Data have shown these differences for cases and fatalities, but data on other types of adversities are lacking. Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of adversity relating to the COVID-19 pandemic by socioeconomic position (SEP) during the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. METHODS: Data were from 12 527 UK adults in the University College London COVID-19 Social Study (a panel study that involves online weekly data collection from participants during the COVID-19 pandemic). We analysed data collected from 25 March to 14 April 2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and country of living. We used Poisson and logit models to assess 10 different types of adverse experiences depending on an index of SEP over time. RESULTS: There was a clear gradient across the number of adverse events experienced each week by SEP. This was most clearly seen for adversities relating to finances (including loss of employment and cut in income) and basic needs (including access to food and medications) but less for experiences directly relating to the virus. Inequalities were maintained with no reductions in discrepancies between socioeconomic groups over time. CONCLUSIONS: There were clear inequalities in adverse experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. Results suggest that measures taken to try to reduce such adverse events did not go far enough in tackling inequality.",2020,"Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,#542132,,,,,219399568.0,en,background despite medium claim coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 unite society country share experience concern pandemic fact expose widen exist inequality society data difference case fatality datum type adversity lack study explore change pattern adversity relate covid-19 pandemic socioeconomic position sep early week lockdown uk methods data 12 527 uk adult university college london covid-19 social study panel study involve online weekly datum collection participant covid-19 pandemic analyse datum collect 25 march 14 april 2020 sample well-stratified weight population proportion gender age ethnicity education country live use poisson logit model assess 10 different type adverse experience depend index sep time results clear gradient numb adverse event experience week sep clearly adversity relate finance include loss employment cut income basic need include access food medication little experience directly relate virus inequalities maintain reduction discrepancy socioeconomic group time conclusions clear inequality adverse experience covid-19 pandemic early week lockdown uk results suggest measure try reduce adverse event far tackle inequality,156

However, it is currently unclear which protease(s) facilitate viral spread in the infected host. We report here that the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777, ((2S)-N-[(1E,3S)-1-(benzenesulfonyl)-5-phenylpent-1-en-3-yl]-2-{[(E)-4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl]amino}-3-phenylpropanamide) and closely-related vinylsulfones act as broad-spectrum antivirals by targeting cathepsin-mediated cell entry. K11777 is already in advanced stages of development for a number of parasitic diseases, such as Chagas disease, and has proven to be safe and effective in a range of animal models. K11777 inhibition of SARS-CoV and Ebola virus entry was observed in the sub-nanomolar range. In order to assess, whether cysteine or serine proteases promote viral spread in the host, we compared the antiviral activity of an optimized K11777-derivative with that of camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and related serine proteases. Employing a pathogenic animal model of SARS-CoV infection, we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is driven by serine rather than cysteine proteases and can be effectively prevented by camostat. Camostat has been clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis, and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory coronavirus infections. Our results indicate that camostat, or similar serine protease inhibitors, might be an effective option for treatment of SARS and potentially MERS, while vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors are excellent lead candidates for Ebola virus therapeutics.",2015-04-01,"Zhou, Yanchen; Vedantham, Punitha; Lu, Kai; Agudelo, Juliet; Carrion, Ricardo; Nunneley, Jerritt W.; Barnard, Dale; Pöhlmann, Stefan; McKerrow, James H.; Renslo, Adam R.; Simmons, Graham",Antiviral Research,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4774534.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666761/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215000248; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215000248,1992699.0,en,"order gain entry cell diverse virus include ebola virus sars-coronavirus emerge mers-coronavirus depend activation envelope glycoprotein host cell protease respective enzyme excellent target antiviral intervention cell culture activation ebola virus good sars- mers-coronavirus accomplish endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin l ctsl cathepsin b ctsb addition sars- mers-coronavirus use serine protease localize cell surface activation currently unclear protease(s facilitate viral spread infect host report cysteine protease inhibitor k11777 (2s)-n-[(1e,3s)-1-(benzenesulfonyl)-5-phenylpent-1-en-3-yl]-2-{[(e)-4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl]amino}-3-phenylpropanamide closely-related vinylsulfones act broad-spectrum antiviral target cathepsin-mediated cell entry k11777 advance stage development numb parasitic disease chagas disease prove safe effective range animal model k11777 inhibition sars-cov ebola virus entry observe sub-nanomolar range order assess cysteine serine protease promote viral spread host compare antiviral activity optimize k11777-derivative camostat inhibitor tmprss2 relate serine protease employing pathogenic animal model sars-cov infection demonstrate viral spread pathogenesis sars-cov drive serine cysteine protease effectively prevent camostat camostat clinically use treat chronic pancreatitis represent excite potential therapeutic respiratory coronavirus infection result indicate camostat similar serine protease inhibitor effective option treatment sars potentially mers vinyl sulfone-based inhibitor excellent lead candidate ebola virus therapeutics",173

In spite of the policy implications for outbreak response, the “capacity” and “will” explanations have not been systematically examined. Analysis of a dataset coding the timeliness of outbreak reporting from 1996–2014 finds evidence that states’ unwillingness to report—rather than just their inability—leads to delayed reporting.

134475,33isjnvc,,WHO,Antiviral effects of probiotic metabolites on COVID-19,,,,unk,"SARS coronavirus (COVID-19) is a real health challenge of the 21st century for scientists, health workers, politicians, and all humans that has severe cause epidemic worldwide. The virus exerts its pathogenic activity through by mechanism and gains the entry via spike proteins (S) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins on host cells. The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the residual binding protein (RBP) on spike proteins (S), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins by probiotics namely Plantaricin BN, Plantaricin JLA-9, Plantaricin W, Plantaricin D along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Docking studies were designed in order to obtain the binding energies for Plantaricin metabolites. The binding energies for Plantaricin W were -14.64, -11.1 and -12.68 for polymerase, RBD and ACE2 respectively comparatively very high with other compounds. Plantaricin W, D, and JLA-9 were able to block the residues (THR556, ALA558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (VAL557) of RdRp making them more therapeutically active for COVID-19. Molecular dynamics studies further strengthen stability of the complexes of plantaricin w and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme, RBD of spike protein, and human ACE2 receptor. The present study present multi-way options either by blocking RBD on S proteins or interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by Plantaricin molecules paving a way that can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 until some better option will be available.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Moreover, mesh shrinkage during subsequent wound healing cannot be detected in vivo without invasive diagnostics. Using MRI-visible polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh, the extend of mesh deformation and shrinkage could be objectified by MRI for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation was performed in 10 female rabbits using ferro-oxide loaded PVDF meshes. MRI measurements were performed postoperatively at days 1 and 90. After three-dimensional reconstruction of all MRI images the total surface and the effective surface of the implanted mesh were explored and calculated computer-assisted. RESULTS In all cases, the mesh could be identified in MRI. The subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction always allowed a calculation of the mesh area. In relation to the original size of the used textile implant, we found neither a significant reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of the pneumoperitoneum at day 1 after laparoscopic surgery nor a significant change of the total surface of this large pore mesh by the end of the observation period. CONCLUSIONS In vivo investigation of mesh surface via MRI could exclude a significant initial reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of pneumoperitoneum, in this IPOM rabbit model.

An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10, in PRRS may impair the immune response of the lung. Pulmonary macrophage subpopulations have a range of susceptibilities to different PRRSV strains and different capacities to express cytokines. Infection with PRRSV decreases the bactericidal activity of macrophages, which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. PRRSV infection is associated with an increase in concentrations of haptoglobin, which may interact with the virus receptor (CD163) and induce the synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines modulates the expression of CD163, which may affect the pathogenicity and replication of the virus in different tissues.

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.

To minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, attention is directed at avoidance of alveolar overdistention and cyclical opening and closing. The lowest possible plateau pressure and tidal volume (V(T)) should be selected. A reasonable target V(T) in all mechanically ventilated patients is 6 mL/kg. A topic of much controversy is the optimal setting of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Results of a meta-analysis using individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for moderate and severe ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in patients with mild ARDS. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding overdistention. Volume and pressure limitation during mechanical ventilation can be described in terms of stress and strain.

Methods: Bioimpedance measurements were taken among 19 non-elite runners at 24 h pre-race, immediately post-race, and at 48 h post-race. The bioimpedance measurements were analyzed by BIVA using the Hotelling's T2 test. The runners were divided according to a cutoff of serum creatinine level immediately post-race in G1 (<1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level) and G2 (≥1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level). The increase of the serum creatinine levels in 83% of G2 runners was related to acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 1. Results: Neither G1 nor G2 showed a creatinine clearance rate (CCr) lower than 60 ml/min. G2 showed a significant increase in CRP values at 48 h post-race vs baseline compared to G1 (P < 0.05), with over 5 mg/L (6.8-15.2) in 92% of the runners, and in CK values with over 215 U/L (282-1,882) at 48 h post-race in 100% of the runners. By BIVA, the 95% confidence ellipses of G2 showed shorter bioimpedance vectors than G1, with a noticeable minor Xc/H (P < 0.01), indicating an expansion on extracellular water and inflammation. The runners with 48 h post-race Xc/H values ≤30.5 Ω, with a decrease from -3 to -12% with respect to the Xc/H value at 24 h pre-race, indicated AKI stage 1 with 85.7% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with a direct correlation between AKI stage 1 with greater CRP values at 48 h post-race and bioimpedance vector displacement, but not with CK values at 48 h post-race.

The results show that over 80% of participants experienced distortion to the passage of time during lockdown in comparison with normal. The passage of time during the day was predicted by age, stress, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. A slowing of the passage of time was associated with increasing age, increasing stress, reduced task load and reduced satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. Only age and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction predicted passage of time across a week.

Not surprisingly, relationships between airports vary widely, due to a myriad of geographic, economic, political and historical determinants. Further, given the dynamic nature of the many influences acting on the air transportation system, inter-airport relationships and the structure of the global air network as a whole are also constantly changing. The purpose of this paper is to explore such spatio-temporal variations in the structure of the global airport hierarchies. Here, we show how the concept of nodal regions can be applied to measure the extent of these variations. To facilitate this analysis, a database of nearly 900 airline carrier schedules and 4650 worldwide origins and destinations, representing a nearly complete record of commercial air travel over a six-year period, is examined. Given this dataset, nodal regions are derived for all airports represented. In general, results suggest that regions associated with individual airports are often relatively dynamic at the yearly as well as quarterly level.

This equivalence is a very intuitive extension of classic bisimulation equivalence (over labeled transition systems) to BPP nets and it is checked in a distributed manner, without building a global model of the overall behavior of the marked BPP net. This paper has three goals.

This paper examines air flow path and airborne pollutant distribution by computational fluid dynamics modeling and field measurement. In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the “low-level extraction” technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone.

In the last century, there has been a substantial improvement in technology, which over the years has opened the door to a new form of medical practicing known as telemedicine. METHODS Healthcare workers from three hospitals involved in the care for COVID-19 patients in the united states were invited to share their experience using telemedicine to deliver clinical care to their patients. RESULTS Since the appearance of this worldwide outbreak, social distancing has been a key factor in preventing the spread of the virus, for which measures have been taken to limit physical contact. Because of the ongoing situation, telemedicine has been progressively incorporated into the physician-patient encounters and quickly has become an essential component in the day-today medical practice.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three surgeons with previous experience in LESS performed 12 nephrectomies in six pigs. In all procedures, a multichannel access device (X-CONE) and a 5-mm extra-long telescope were used. Four sets of prebent instruments with different profiles (S-portal) were tested: Standard (one straight scissors and one curved grasper), Cuschieri, Carus, and Leroy set (each of them consisting of two curved instruments with different configurations). Assessment was performed based on both objective (procedure time; time to manage the pedicle; time to free kidney) and subjective parameters (entry/exit of instruments; triangulation; dissection up/down; dissection lateral; retraction; interdependence). The subjective assessment tool used was a Likert type scale (1 = easy to 5 = prohibitive). The access device was assessed by using objective (time to complete insertion of device after skin incision) and subjective (significant air leakage, movement constraint) parameters. RESULTS Time to insertion of the X-CONE was <1 minute in all the cases. Surgeons reported significant insufflant leakage in 58% of cases. The procedure was completed in 10/12 (83%) cases. Mean operative time was 8.3 ± 4.2 minutes, being lower for the Carus group (4.5 min) and higher for the standard group (13 min).

Comparison of hematological parameters between mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV 2 is so far limited, but significant differences in parameters such as interleukin-6, d-dimers, glucose, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein have been already reported. PURPOSE In this study we analyzed the changes observed in easily measured blood biomarkers in the patients and provided evidence of how these markers can be used as prognostic factors of the disease. METHODS Demographic characteristics, detailed medical history, and laboratory findings of all enrolled SARS-CoV 2 infection positive patients who were referred to Patras University Hospital from the period of March 4th 2020 (when first confirmed case in Greece appeared in our hospital) until April 4th 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed. RESULTS We provided evidence that some very common laboratory values can be used as independent predictive factors in SARS-CoV 2 infection. Despite the retrospective nature of this study and the small number of subjects analyzed, we showed that NLR, LDH, d-dimers, CRP, fibrinogen and ferritin can be used early at the patient's first visit for SARS-CoV 2 infection symptoms and can predict the severity of infection.

Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Greater attention must be paid to animal and environmental biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts. Common sense management in cattle, historical facts, experience based practice cultural and social aspects, combined with research, would depict that having adequately optimised balanced diets for the replacements, without producing excessive body conditions, could achieve a production of healthy replacements with superior levels of milk production. Continual video monitoring of the herd, modern thermal infrared imaging of the dry cows and calves body parts to identify early symptoms, and overall animal health and biosecurity risk analysis could achieve a sustainable and efficient replacement management practice in cattle industry.",2016-12-31,"Dutta, Ritaban",Reference Module in Food Science,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a4c7bb047e92c0257e95ede0cf25233469c16588.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157480.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780081005965010350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005965010350,111839855.0,en,replacements future dairy industry focusing improve health management replacement yield tremendous return decrease loss animal great genetic potential dairy decrease cost medication improve growth rate improve fee efficiency early entry milk herd health management begin replacement bear attention nutrition lactate dry cow vaccination lactate dry cow control length dry period control disease status dam cleanliness calve environment greater attention pay animal environmental biosecurity prevent introduction disease herd digestive disorder diarrhea internal parasite appropriate vaccination program calve health management replacement overlook producer immediate return effort common sense management cattle historical fact experience base practice cultural social aspect combine research depict adequately optimise balance diet replacement produce excessive body condition achieve production healthy replacement superior level milk production continual video monitor herd modern thermal infrared image dry cow calve body identify early symptom overall animal health biosecurity risk analysis achieve sustainable efficient replacement management practice cattle industry,145
